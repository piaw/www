<h1>An Engineer's Guide to Silicon Valley Startups</h1>
</center>
</DIV>

<DIV class="body2">
<p>
I've worked at 5 different startups in my career in Silicon
Valley. While every company is unique, there are many similarities
between Silicon Valley startups. As workplaces go, Silicon Valley
startups embody the American dream: they're exciting, fun, and provide
employees with great flexibility and freedom. Join the right startup, and
you can change the world!

This book covers topics of interest to anyone who wants to work at
startups:
<ul>
<li>How do you get a job at a startup?</li>
<li>How do you choose which startups to talk to?</li>
<li>How do you approach interviewing at a startup?</li>
<li>How would you negotiate compensation?</li>
<li>Once at a startup, what should you do to maximize gains from
  stock options?</li>
<li>Why is it advantageous to exercise your stock options in certain
  conditions?</li>
<li>What do the clauses in your offer letter mean?</li>
<li>How do the clauses in your stock options contract affect you?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Drawing from my 17 years of experience at various pre-IPO
companies in Silicon Valley, I provide answers to the above
questions. Extensive examples, case studies, and detailed background
are in the book.

After learning about the personal finance side of handling stock
options, I joined Google less than a year before the IPO and
discovered that what I had learned was hardly common
knowledge. Despite explaining the details to several colleagues, many
chose not to do the financially advantageous thing, leading to an
increased tax liability of several hundred thousand dollars.

This book was the result of observing these failures, and trying to
prevent others from making the same mistakes.
<p>Read <a href="http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/02/story-behind-book.html">the story behind the book</a>
<h3>What's different about this book?</h3>
<ul>

<li>Emphasis on the engineering non-founder. Most startup books are
focused on the founder(s). For every founder at a successful company,
there are hundreds of non-founders. This book is for everyone who is
not a founder. I don't tell you how to raise money or read a
term-sheet. That's the founder's job. Frequently, the founder's goals
and your goals are different. For instance, when negotiating
compensation, the employee and employer sit on opposite sides of the
table.
<li>Short and to the point. Pages are not wasted telling you how to
write a resume. I <b>show</b> you how an engineering interviewer
thinks. I did over 300 interviews for Google, and sat on a hiring
committee for 3 years. Before that, I was an engineering manager for 3
different startups and also performed hundreds of interviews.
<li>Covers the important tax planning topics that very few startups
will tell you because of fear of lawsuits. Employers are <b>not</b>
allowed to push their stock onto their employees.
<li>Quotes and experience from well-known successful startup experts
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rosing">Wayne
Rosing</a> (Google's first Senior VP of
Engineering), <a href="http://www.accel.com/bio/jeffrothschild.php">Jeff
Rothschild</a> (VP of Technology at Facebook, Co-Founder of Veritas,
Co-Founder of Mpath Interactive), and other startup veterans.
<li>More importantly, you'll get to learn what other engineers think!

<li>Having worked at three different startups and three large corporations
all of different size and dynamics I can really relate to the topic. I
remember working with Piaw at Escalate and I can say without any doubt
that he was one of the smartest people I met. He has a certain winning
attitude which is always reflected in everything he does, be it
designing systems, cycling or writing a book. His new book is full of
great ideas and communicates well some of the common dilemmas many
engineers face when they choose to try out a startup.  I find all of
the advice he gives to be very practical and downright useful. -- Robert Emmery, <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>.
