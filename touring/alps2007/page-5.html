<h2>Day 5: Hospental to Chur (100.8km, 1038m)</h2>
<p>
The morning did not look as bad as we feared, but we stuck to our plan
and headed for Andermatt, seeing members of the Swiss Ski team ski
past us going the other way on roller skis adapted for summer
training. In Andermatt, we stopped at a supermarket to buy more
bananas, and met a bunch of high schoolers on a bicycle tour, led by a
teacher or two. They said they were going to head up Furka and
Grimsel. We told them they were likely to see snow, but they seemed
dressed for cold weather anyway.

<p>
Oberalp pass(2044m) is very easy and fast from Andermatt, though as we
made the climb we saw members of the ski team on skis make their way
up the slope on what appeared to be an astonishingly fast pace. They
stopped before they got to me, however, so I never did get an idea of
how fast they were.
<p>
At the summit lake, I put on everything and started the descent first,
trusting the others to catch up to me. They caught up sooner than
expected as I dropped my cell phone from my handlebar bag, and we then
proceeded down towards Disentis and then Ilanz against a growing
headwind. Past Disentis, Mike went to the front and pulled strongly
for about 15km, getting us to Ilanz by lunch time. There we ate a good
meal, and took the OCD recommended route towards Velandes and
Versams. This road takes you away from the busy main road (as well as
the astonishingly mountain bike-oriented touring route) into a wooded
climb and then a lovely canyon descent, where road signs pointed us
towards Chur.

<p>
There, our riding took on a hurried urgency as the first rain drops
started to be felt. The push into Chur went on and on and the rain got
harder and harder and started to sting when it fell on bare
skin. Soon, however, we were in downtown Chur, where I stopped to
inquire about prices at the first hotel we saw, Hotel Chur. The
beautiful blonde behind the counter told me she would give us a
special rate: 4 individual rooms at 80 CHF each, the price of 2
doubles. I inquired as to the preferences of my companions and they
jumped at the opportunity to stop riding, despite the early hour of
3pm.
<p>
It being so early, after we had showered I organized a laundry run,
since this town had a laundrette just around the corner from the
hotel. There was also a sports shop across the street from the
laundrette, and since Roberto had complained about poor shifting from
his chain, we bought a new 9-speed chain for him. A visit to the
internet cafe was also in order. I bought more chocolate, as well as
fresh batteries for my front light, which I had accidentally left on
the day before after a long tunnel run. I also asked the receptionist
which direction Lenzerheide was, upon which I realized how lucky we
were to be in the hotel directly across the street from where the road
began. There would be no traversing the city tomorrow morning.

<p>
Dinner was at the pizzeria just across the street, which provided lots
of food at reasonable prices. The rain came and went the rest of the
evening but we slept well, each in our cocoon of a room.
