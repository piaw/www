<h2>Prologue
</h2>
<p>
On Thursday, June 21st, Roberto Peon, <a
href="http://www.mikesamuel.com">Mike Samuel</a> and I flew into
Zurich for a Tour of the Swiss, Italian, and Austrian Alps. Arriving
at the airport's international terminal 3 hours before the flight was
due, I had a hard time finding the USAirways check-in counter. I
eventually discovered that they were in the Domestic Terminal, and
there Roberto was in the check-in line. We tried to check-in, but
discovered that USAirways did not provide bike boxes, so I went to the
United Airlines counter to buy some.
<p>
United Airlines sold me 3 bike boxes for $30 and taxes, and I came
back to the USAirways counter with the boxes to find that everything
had been done except the bike boxing, so we packed the bikes in the
boxes, and they charged us $80 for each bike to fly with them, despite
the fact that in the past I had never been charged for flying with a
bicycle. As before, I checked in my saddlebag, and carried a backpack
for a laptop, a few books, and other sundries that I might need for
the plane flight.
<p>
The flight was late by 2 hours into Philadelphia, but they held our
flight for Frankfurt. We arrived at Frankfurt a grand total of 4 hours
late, however, and were rebooked for a flight into Zurich with
SwissAir. Arriving in Zurich, my saddlebag rolled off the lugguage
carousel, but nothing else did, and our bikes were lost as well. So we
spent a half hour at the lost lugguage counter before getting our SIM
cards and going to the office in Zurich.
<p>
There, we caught up with friends, got keys to the apartment, and then
took a Taxi (after grabbing dinner) to RehalpStrasse. The weather was
breezy but not at all unpleasant, but the lack of bicycles made the
mood sour.
<p>
My brother, Sy arrived late at night after flying from Dublin and
London, and announced that he had sighted our bikes at the airport! We
went to sleep knowing that we wouldn't be buying new bikes for the
trip.
