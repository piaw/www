<h2>Day 22: Rickterswil to Rickterswil (21km, 601m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up at 7:00am, and got on our bikes to follow Stefan up to
Etzel, where we were promised good views of the lakes and perhaps the
alps. The road wound around Wallenrou, and then Stefan chose a few
dirt short cuts, one of which was steep enough to cause me to lose
traction on 25mm tires. At some point, we linked up again to Swiss
Bike Route number 9 for the last push to Etzel, but Jennie had SMS'd
me that she was arriving in Zurich by train at noon, so I had to turn
around 1km from the top and terminate the last day of riding in
Switzerland early.
