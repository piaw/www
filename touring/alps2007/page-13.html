<h2>Day 13: Canazei to Sottoguda (86.7km, 2623m)</h2>
<p>
The day started off overcast as we once again attempted Sella pass. On
the way up, an English speaker pulled up next to me (in his car) and
said, "faster!" I looked at him and realized it was a car carrying
bikes. These were the people doing the Italian passes Brett
Lider-style. They would base themselves out of a town, ride a few
passes, and then drive on to the next. "Where are you going today?"
"We're doing the Sella Circuit."  "We're going to Arraba and ranging
further today. Where are you based out of?" Some people can't conceive
of carrying their own lugguage on their bikes (and therefore not
having a fixed base), so I took the easy way and told him we were
based out of Canazei. He zoomed off in his car and I never saw him
again.
<p>
It was here that I realized that Sella really was quite steep and got
to the summit after Mike by a good 10 minutes. After a hot chocolate,
I decided to press on while Mike waited for Roberto. Traffic was busy
on the Sella circuit as I found myself stuck behind tourist busses on
the descent, before starting up the climb to Passo Gardena
(2121m). There, I got a call from Roberto saying he had turned around
to make a phone call to his girlfriend. Well, there was not much to do
about it except to keep going to Corvara, where I turned right again
onto the road leading up to Passo Campolongo (1875m). As I exited the
town of Corvara, rain started up again, and I quickly dove under the
porch of a nearby house. Mike called me and told me he had seen no
sign of Roberto and I told him what happened. He too, was caught in
the rain and would wait it out and then catch up with me.

<p>
After a bit, the rain stopped and I rode out of town and over Passo
Campolongo, an easy and gentle pass into the town of Arraba. There, I
saw dark clouds coming off Pordoi and called Roberto to ask about
conditions in Canazei. He told me it's raining, so I waited for Mike
and then we had lunch before attempting Pordoi.
<p>
The weather still wasn't perfect, and we had to duck under the porches
of a few rental apartments (a denizen of which let me into the
building to use the toilet). But after a while I could see Mike was
getting impatient and the rain wasn't getting any worse (or better),
so we took a chance and just went for the pass.
<p>
We felt a few sprinkles as we climbed Passo Pordoi but go to the top
without getting rained on and immediately began the descent to
Canazei, where we had made arrangements to pick up our lugguage to
move on. We paid our bills, put baggage back on the bikes, and started
down the road towards Fedaia pass (2057m). The air was heavy with
moisture as we made it slowly up, and the few sprinkles quickly turned
into rain and mild hail just as we reached the first of the
galleries. Mike was unhappy about doing so much not-riding today, but
the rest of us didn't feel like getting terribly wet.
<p>
The waiting yielded clear results this time, and we went through a few
more galleries before the long, lit tunnel to emerge from the
other side onto Lake Fedaia. From there, we could see blue sky on the
descent, which boosted our morale tremendously. Thoughts of staying at
the summit hotels disappeared from my mind and we prepared for an
immediate descent of the pass.

<p>
Jobst Brandt calls Fedaia the <a
href="http://www.trentobike.org/Countries/Europe/Tour_Reports/Tour_of_the_Alps/1997/3.html">fastest
road in the Dolomites</a> for its long straight 13% grades, and knowing Roberto
to be much faster at descents than I am, I provided directions: "At the bottom,
you cross the bridge and there should be a town there, try to find a good hotel
there."
<p>
We then rode the flat area to the end of the reservoir and then
started the descent. Even with Jobst's warnings in my mind, I couldn't
help but be surprised by how steep and fast Fedaia was. My cantilever
brakes, which before the tour had been quiet even on loaded fast
descents had become quite loud, and never being one to push descending
speeds even in the best of times, I took it easy and did not exceed
70kph. Roberto, however broke 90kph easily.
<p>
The twist and turns eventually led over a bridge into the town of
Sottoguda, where Roberto pointed me at a hotel. I looked at my
altimeter, which read something in the neighborhood of 1200m, and
said, "You have another 400m of descent to go." "Yes," replied
Roberto, "But have you ever seen me pass up a chance to sleep high and
cool?" Mike appeared to be happy just to not be in the same valley as
Canazei, so I assented.
<p>

<p>
The hotel was an excellent value, charging us a mere 35 Euros each for
dinner, breakfast and lodging. The day was late, and the dinner
excellent. I slept well, knowing that we had done 5 passes that day.
