<h2>Day 20: Schwyz to Goschenen (121km, 2731m)</h2>
<p>
Thursday morning looked cloudy, but the weather radar said the rain
was North of Plagelpass (1550m), so Stefan, Mike and I caught the
7:50 train, and after making a dizzying number of train changes, ended
up in Schwyz at 9:10am. There, Mike and I stuffed a left-lugguage
locker with our lugguage, and we proceeded up towards Muotothal (624m)
along the deceptively easily rolling grade. At Muotathal, we stopped
at the grocery store to buy bananas and chocolate before beginning the
climb at the edge of town.
<p>

<p>
The climb, which starts at a furious grade, wound its way along the
forest for awhile before becoming much gentler and cooler. I snapped a
few pictures while riding, causing Stefan to call me "not a serious
photographer", which I happily admitted to, preferring the
uninterrupted cycling experience to better pictures. Even unloaded, it
took us until 11:00am to get to the top. From the summit, we could
easily see that the surrounding peaks had a fresh coating of powder
from the recent storms, which had brought snow levels down to as
little as 2000m. Stefan was still hoping to get to work at a
reasonable hour, so he took off down the hill at a furious pace. I had
neglected to get reasonable pictures of the Kloentaler See before, so I
did not make that mistake this time, stopping 2 or 3 times to get a
few pictures.
<p>

<p>
The descent to Glarus (472m) didn't take long at all, and Stefan sped off there
to catch the train to Zurich by about 2 minutes. Mike and I kept rolling towards
Linthal (648m), stopping in Schwanden for a pizza lunch. I should tell everyone
at this point that when you approach Linthal, follow the signs to Ruti, which
yields a nicer route with fewer tunnels. I had done so last time but forgot to
do so this time. We stopped near Linthal to pick up water and started up the
cobblestone section that denoted the start of the climb, along with the
bicyclist height and distance signs.
<p>
The steep sections above Linthal this time were much more enjoyable,
since the sun had emerged, granting us grand views of the valley and
the surrounding high peaks, being snow covered gleamed like teeth in a
toothpaste commercial. I snapped several pictures, telling Mike that
last time I came through here all I saw was sheets of water coming
from the sky.
<p>
Once into Urnerboden (1300m), the valley starts and became easy
rolling for a while. We stopped in the valley to relieve ourselves and
eat more food. Despite our 3 days of rest, we did not feel fresh, but
instead felt parched, drinking water at a great rate.
<p>

<p>
Fortunately, the final push up Klausen pass (1948m) is accompanied by
progressively cooler temperatures. This time, I really got to
appreciate how beautiful the pass was: surrounded by nearly vertical
walls, we could see the dark red rocks as we approached the summit. At
the top, we stopped to put on warmer clothing and started down the
glorius descent, marred only by my consistently juddering brakes,
despite new pads freshly installed yesterday. The panaromic views down
the valley were nothing short of amazing as you skirt along the
mountain side at high speed that you see only in nature documentaries.
<p>

<p>
The retro-grade past Urigen (1300m) was no problem at all as we swept
on and on towards Altdorf. In downtown Altdorf we stopped at the Spar
for our usual staples. Mike went in to negotiate the transactions
while I recalled my last entry into that supermarket, lips blue and so
cold I could not say more than a few words. What a difference two
years makes.
<p>
It being 5:30, we decided to skip the last ride into Schwyz, and made
our way to the Fluelen train station, arriving through the pedestrian
passage under the main road just in time to see a train and a
conductor. After asking if it went to Schwyz, he motioned us onto the
train, and we paid for the tickets once onboard.
<p>
Once in Schwyz, we picked up our lugguage and bought tickets for
Goschenen (1011m). The train arrived at 6:00pm, and I bought the
tickets at 6:02pm, so we were just in time. Dropped off in Goschenen
at 6:50, we found lodging at the Hotel Rossli and had a pleasant
dinner in the restaurant.
