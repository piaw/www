<h2>Day 17: Bludenz to Zurich (4km, 0m)</h2>
<p>
As I have <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/choonpiaw/alps2005/day020.html">mentioned
before</a>, those who say that the worst day on the bike beats the best day in
the office don't work at Google. So it was that when it poured in the morning,
we agreed to ride to the train station and buy train tickets for Zurich (40
Euros including bike fare!). I wasn't pleased about not getting to ride more but
the forecast for the next 2 days were for rain everywhere we could see, and the
office was nice.

<p>
We had rain all the way to Zurich, but from the dry comfort of the
train it was more than tolerable. On arrival, we were greeted by our
friends including Stefan, who agreed to let us stay with him.
