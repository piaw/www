<h2>Day 15: Sterzing to Solden (96.2km, 3019m)</h2>
<p>
The morning granted me with no fresh bed bug bites, so I thanked my
lucky stars. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was excellent, to
my surprise (given the conditions of the rooms), and we were out
riding in a good mood. I asked a pedestrain on how to get to
Jaufenpass (2099m), and she told us to follow the directions towards the
Auto-strada, which would lead us to it. Sure enough, as we approached
the Auto-strada, signs started telling us which way to Jaufenpass.
<p>
Soon the climb started in the woods as the pass made one winding turn
after another. I started eating bananas while riding (they are the
perfect riding food: biodegradable wrappers you can peel with your
teeth, tasty, and they come packaged with their own water), not
wishing to stop just to eat and drink. My knee was mostly recovered
but still not at 100%, while Roberto was bothered by the halo of flies
each of us gathered while climbing in the woods. He was even more
dismayed when he passed me that part of my halo went to join
his. Maybe flies are attracted to warm temperatures, and I run a
little cooler than Roberto.
<p>
As we exited the treeline, more and more unloaded cyclists passed us,
and the sightlines got much longer, allowing us o see the glaciers of
Hocheck, Botzer, as well as across the valley to the East. We did not
stop long at the top of Jaufenpass, just long enough to take on
water. In the past, Roberto had complained of heavy lunches in valley
making for tough climbing in the afternoon, so I proposed that we did
not stop for lunch but just ate powerfood as we climbed. Mike agreed,
as did Roberto, but unbeknownst to me Roberto was not carrying any
food!
<p>

<p>
The descent down Jaufenpass is steep and fast, with rough pavement,
relatively poor sightlines, but also fortunately not too much
traffic. There were several straight sections where you could pick up
a lot of speed but then would have to bleed it off quickly for the
next blind corner. Roberto went ahead and shot photographs as we came
down the mountain. Finally, as we made the final corner on the
approach to St. Leonard (688m), I heard the frantic rattling of a cowbell
worn by an angry cow chasing an enemy. I turned my head to see Mike on
the road. It took me a bit to stop the bike. I asked if Mike was OK,
but he was apparently not, so I turned and walked back to him.
<p>
Apparently, he had suffered a front puncture (a snakebite) which caused a
somersault over the bike which Roberto witnessed. We got his bike off the road
and him, and Roberto proceeded to dig through his first aid kit for antibiotic
wipes. I took one of them and proceeded to scrub Mike's wounds while he
attempted to fix the tire. Adding to busy moment, my phone rang, with Jennie
telling me that she had gotten into the Dolomites at 3 in the morning, and so
she would not be up for meeting up today. We told her Mike had crashed and asked
Mike if he needed a pickup, he shook his head, so we proceeded with patching him
up and fixing the bike and said goodbye to Jennie.
<p>
"You have to stop crashing in Italy, Mike" I said. "That's it. I've
had enough, we're not doing any more descents in this country." It
turned out that Mike had indeed crashed on the last 100m of descent in
Italy. When we got going again, at the next corner the road flattened
out and immediately started a gentle climb up Timmelsjoch (2504m).
<p>
The climb started out gently enough, and we tried to take it easy at
the lower altitudes where it was warmest, but still ended up using
water at an alarming rate. At least in the heat there weren't any
annoying flies to bother us. At Moso in Passinia, we stopped at a
fountain outside the tourist information center to refill and realized
we had dropped Roberto. Well, there seemed to be restaurants and
fountains so we went on ahead. I reasoned that Roberto would catch us,
since he overtook me on Jaufenpass earlier this morning.
<p>
The climb wound its way back and forth along the mountain side,
occasionally becoming steep enough that I had to get off the saddle
and stand even in my lowest gears. Given the temperature and the
length of the climb, I instituted a strict timetable for eating and
drinking for myself and Mike: we would stop every 45 minutes to an
hour to down some salt and food.
<p>
We found more water at a restaurant near 1900m before the road went into the
final push. I was pretty worn out, so could only manage 6kph or so at this
point, and stopped at 2250m to eat more food while Mike pushed ahead. It was at
this point where I realized that my map was wrong. Instead of being 2474m high,
Timmelsjoch was more than 2500m. Since my altimeter agreed with the summit sign
later on, I'll take that as the true value of Timmelsjoch summit.
<p>
By and by, I got to the summit tunnel, where after a few pictures, I
made it through, lights blinking and helmet on to the no-man's land
between Italy and Austria. This was truly beautiful, and my pictures
did not do this section justice. The valley between the countries
looked truly desolate, while the bare mountains stood as though they
were holding up the sky.
<p>

<p>
After a bit of riding I saw Mike's bike up against an inn fence. He
had gone in and ordered a plate of spaghetti. I asked for one too and
we ate outside while waiting for Roberto. After downing the plates in
record time, we looked around the mountain, and got a few pictures. We
discussed the possibility of me going down to town to get us lodging,
as it was a Friday night. Solden (1368m) on the map looked reasonably
big, and reasonably high, so I headed down the hill, after first
talking to two German tourists who had made it up from Otz today, and
had started touring from Garmish in Germany the day before. They
seemed entranced by my Carradice saddlebag, asking if I had made it
myself. I explained that it was English and you could buy it, and they
said their panniers tempted them into carrying too much.
<p>
With photographs exchanged, I descended Timmelsjoch on the Austrian
side and the difference between Austrian and Italian engineering
became immediately obvious. Where the Italian side of the pass was
steep and narrow, the Austrian side was wide and sweeping, with
beautifully constructed turns that even with my crummy brake setup
were a joy to ride and float through. This is what cycling is like:
flying without leaving the ground.
<p>

<p>
At Hochgurgl, I followed the bicycle signs bypassing the toll-booth and rode on
down, taking pictures because I was so enchanted by the beauty of the road. Past
the turnoff to Obergurgl there was longish retro-grade, and I knew that if
Roberto was having a bad day this would not be a happy place for him. Similarly,
there was a retrograde past Zwieselstein, and I arrived at Solden to find the
tourist information closed. Due to the retrogrades, my altimeter registered
3019m, the day with the most climbing on this trip so far. The lady at the
Intersport recommended <a
href="http://www.castello.at/de/castello_falkner.php">Castello Falkner</a> just
across the stream on the bike bridge to me, however.
<p>
Castello Falkner was a 4-star hotel that looked really grand. The
rooms were really suites, with two bedrooms, a living room, a bathroom
with both shower and jacuzzi, a mini-kitchen, and its own patio
attached to a shared courtyard. The man at the counter offered it to
us at 79 Euros a person a night. This was a bit much, so I rode around
town looking for cheaper places. The 4-star hotel on the main road was
only 4 Euros cheaper. The cheap apartments (though I didn't think I
felt like cooking that night) were all booked for the night. While
mulling things over, I stopped at a supermarket to buy some fruits and
chocolates. At that point, I saw Mike and a very tired looking Roberto
ride past. I ran out of the supermarket to shout at them to turn
around.
<p>
<h1 align=center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/piaw.na/TourOfTheAlps2007Edited/photo#5088394681458066354"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/piaw.na/Rp2cANlLg7I/AAAAAAAABps/RIp_IKnmd3U/s144/P1010045.JPG" /></a></h1>
<p>
Offered the news, they gladly picked Castello Falkner, and we rode
over and took the room. The resort-style dinner as well as the
pleasant surroundings took a lot off the edge of the hard day, and we
said to ourselves that perhaps we should do this more often. I learned
from Mike that as should have been expected, Roberto cursed my name
all the way up every retro-grade from Timmelsjoch, having ran out of
both food and water while climbing Timmelsjoch, having somehow missed
every water stop Mike and I found.
<p>
That night, however, bellies full of food and bodies clean and
healthy, we could not help but be optimistic for the next day.
