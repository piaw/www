<h2>Day 14: Sottoguda to Sterzing (81km, 1813m)</h2>
<p>
The morning found me with a sore left knee, probably from a
combination of trauma from the hail two days ago and the hard efforts
of the day before. So rather than attempt Passo di Giau (2233m), I
proposed we take the OCD recommended route through Digonera to pick up
Passo di Falzerego (2105m) on the way to Cortina (1237m).
<p>
After breakfast we headed down the hill, and even in the last
stretches Fedaia impressed me with its speed, and for more than the
first time on the trip wished I had a touring bike with dual pivot
sidepulls instead of the disastrous design decision that cantilevers
were.
<p>
At the bottom, we turned left towards Digonera and started up a gentle
grade through a well-lit tunnel before the road eased off and wound
along the mountain side, giving us good views of the surrounding
towns: Larzonei, Caprile, and Pian. I have yet to be disappointed by
an OCD-recommended route and this was no exception. There was
additional climbing but it was quite gentle and suitable for someone
nursing a knee along.
<p>
When we merged with the Falzerego highway, I was pleasant surprised by
the relative scarcity of traffic, compared with that of the Sella
Circuit the day before. The views were no less beautiful, and in my
gentle spinning mode I had plenty of time to enjoy them. I arrived at
the summit long after Roberto and Mike, and we initiated the descent
into Cortina.
<p>

<p>
The first parts were gentle and made for suitably fast going, but the views got
dramatically better right after a couple of tunnels and the road soars down to
Cortina, granting views of the Val D'Ampezzo and the Boite River. I stopped a
couple of times for pictures and then followed the others down to Cortina, where
after weaving around old town a bit found a restaurant that served an ample
lunch. At lunch, we ran into an American woman who was in the Dolomites for some
rock climbing. She told us about <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">couch
surfing</a>, a web-site where you could find people to stay with in foreign
countries. The concept sounded interesting, but I thought it would be much
easier for women than for men to find places to stay. In any case, she
identified the tops the mountains in the Dolomites as being limestone, and
apparently is great climbing.
<p>
After lunch we weaved around town and followed the signs up Tre Croci
(1805m). My knee had recovered with the return of warm weather, and I spun up
the mountain at a reasonable pace. The grade, at 12% was reasonably steady as we
passed Gondolas and mountain restaurants. At the top we found an ice-cream
parlor and ate some ice-cream. The kilometer signs, I noticed, however, were
signed for Lake Misurina (1716m), which apparently is the site of Col S'Angelo,
apparently a true Col recognized by the OCD despite the fact that the descent
from Tre Croci was to a mere 1641m before climbing up to the Lake. Mike found it
amusing, and said, "I can climb between these passes all day."
<p>
<h1 align=center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/piaw.na/TourOfTheAlps2007Edited/photo#5088394114522383058"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/piaw.na/Rp2bfNlLgtI/AAAAAAAABn8/qXQCySsEqQU/s144/P1000990.JPG" /></a></h1>
<p>
Lake Misurina was pretty, but overrun by tourists, so we started the
descent down to Hohlenstein valley had a few turns at first that we
could stay ahead of traffic, but at the junction with Highway 51 the
road flattened out and the traffic became annoying. There was a bike
path along the road, but it was a gravel one, slow and unusable for a
road bike on a fast descent. Mike and Roberto took off at a fast pace
towards Tobach (1241m), and I slowly made my way down the valley to
the town, where Roberto had found the train station.
<p>
Italian trains have one major feature, which is that they are cheap (5 Euros to
go from Tobach to Sterzing). In all other respects, there's not much to
recommend them. The train station had no one selling tickets. I first asked a
man in military fatigues for help interpreting the train schedule, but he was
not local so recommended that we went next door to the bike rental place to ask
for help figuring out the train schedule, whereupon we were told that any train
in the direction of Fortezza would work, where upon we could switch to any train
headed for Sterzing (948m). By that time, we had missed the train for the hour.
<p>
It took more time to figure out the machine, but by the time we were
done, we had resigned to waiting an hour in what looked like a
decaying train station. We ate the remains of our bananas and
chocolate, and then others started to join us in waiting for the
train. My friend Jennie Chen called to say that she would be somewhere
in the Dolomites that weekend with her boyfriend, possibly in
Bolzano. I told her we were only 60km from where she would be, and
she promised to call when her plans firmed up.
<p>
The train showed up and we were shown by the conductor to the bike
car, which had ceiling hooks to allow us to store bikes
vertically. Sitting in the bike car, we could see bike paths alongside
the train tracks in the valley, so despite OCD admonitions to the
contrary, it is possible you can use these bike paths to make your way
from one site of the Dolomites to the other, though many would still
consider even these bike paths to be "junk miles."
<p>
Italian trains don't run nearly as accurately on time as Swiss trains,
but we arrived in Sterzing at 6:30, only 15 minutes behind
projections. The train station in Sterzing was across the street from
a grocery store, so I went in and bought up supplies for the next day:
bananas and chocolate.
<p>
Then it was into town to find lodging. We came to a corner with 2
hotels. I checked out one and Mike checked the other. Mine was closed
but Mike's was opened. I asked him how the rooms looked and he thought
they were OK, better than the bed-bug hotel. I accepted his word for
it, but when I saw the room he was shown, my heart sank. I resolved to
spend more money at the next hotel, if I survived the night.
<p>
Dinner was at a reasonably good restaurant in town, but still nothing
that impressed us like Rosenlaui or Hotel Gran Baita, and we talked
over tomorrow's route. We had good weather forecast for tomorrow and
the day after, but after that rain was projected for a few days. So
while I wanted to explore more of Austria that rain nixed that. We
would ride over to Austria tomorrow, and attempt Silvretta on Sunday
before the rains came.
<p>
That night, Jennie called me to say that her train was several hours
late (yes, it was Italian) so she'd likely not join us in the morning
after all.
