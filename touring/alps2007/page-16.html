<h2>Day 16: Solden to Bludenz (172.2km, 1679m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up to clear skies and a huge breakfast. We took a little
longer to get ready, I suspect because we were a little reluctant to
leave such a nice place. Roberto had found a brochure describing the 5
hours of pampered treatment you could get for a comparatively low sum
of money, but Mike and I decided that guys don't go for facials when
they can ride mountains, so he got outvoted.
<p>
The 48km "descent" from Solden to Imst took some doing, as much of it
was flat against a headwind or at best a gentle grade, punctuated with
a few fast sections. I got dropped rapidly on the flat sections, and
we rode this way until the road tilted upwards again on the approach
to Imst.
<p>
At Imst, Roberto missed the first Bahnof sign forcing us to chase him
until he realized his error and we turned around, following directions
to the bike path that Jobst had given me more than 4 years ago: look
for the river-rafting put-in, ride into it, and turn right onto the
wooden bridge to the bike path to Landeck.
<p>
The bike path to Landeck was pleasant, weaving along the river, and
then along small city or village streets to Zammerberg and then
Zams. At the Landeck tunnel Roberto discovered that what I thought was
a blocked off bike path was a mistake of mine: if you follow the
pavement, it dead-ends at the Landeck tunnel, but just before that,
there's a gravel path that bypasses the tunnel, and drops you off in
Landeck near a factory.
<p>
At this point, the surroundings had become clouded over, and a few
drops of rain started appearing. Looking at the map at the tourist
center, I realized that I had gotten turned around, and led everyone
out of Landeck. Roberto decided he wanted a real meal today, so we
found a restaurant and ate a sufficient meal. Over lunch, the clouds
had mysteriously disappeared, making Silvretta (2036m) seem like a
real possibility.
<p>
The road to Silvretta from Pians is gentle, even by tandem standards,
rising only 1100m over the course of 49km, of which only the last 5 or
6km were really steep, with sections of 13% grade according to the OCD
guides. Mike & I paced each other over this course, as the headwind
gradually increased in strength and intensity. Past Galtur, the
headwind grew again, slowing my progress to less than 9kph along an
otherwise flat section. The sky had clouded over again, so that by the
time I passed the toll-booth I began to feel rain drops.
<p>

<p>
Along with the wind and the final steep sections, it took me better
than an hour to complete the final section, which I remember taking
very little time in much more pleasant weather in 2003 on the
tandem. At the top, I saw no sign of Mike, so went ahead to the
buildings along the reservoirs, where I put on all my cold and rainy
weather gear.
<p>
I had suggested in previous days that if the weather really sucked, we
could take a break and visit the Zurich office, but that depended on
us getting to somewhere with train service to Zurich, and that was not
at the top of Silvretta, so we would have to make this wet descent,
like it or not.
<p>
After putting on everything I turned around and went up to the first
hotel on the pass, figuring that Mike was likely to stop there, and
indeed there he was, and Roberto arrived soon afterwards, eager to
make this descent rather than stay at the hotel and risk getting
trapped by the weather.
<p>
To give you an idea of how hot it had been before the storm, we
actually saw steam rising from the road as cold water onto hot asphalt
resulted in warm moist air rising from the road. Of course, with cold
rain coming from above we got chilled anyway. The 32 hairpins of
Silvretta, so much fun and so delightful in good conditions became a
chore with wet pavement, wet crummy brakes, and then to top it off we
became stuck behind a tourist bus on hairpin 24. I eventually gave up
in disgust and stopped to let the bus get ahead before tackling the
rest of the descent. My cantilever brakes, which until today had
merely been loud, became downright dangerous, shuddering the entire
bike at each hard braking effort. Despite my efforts for the rest of
the tour, I would never get them working right, a conclusion that
Stefan would concur with me about (he had replaced the cantilevers on
his touring with V-brakes, but you'll have to pry my carbon brake
levers from my warm dead fingers).
<p>
Past the hairpins, we descended to Partenen (1027m), I realized that
the bike path I thought started in Partenen was actually picked up
much later, probably in Gaschurn, where a right turn onto a Volg
supermarket and then riding to the end of the sidewalk there led to
what I hereby dub the bikepath of infinite descent, since that path
descends all the way to Switzerland.
<p>
We followed the bike path to Tschagguns, where we decided to keep
riding to Bludenz. Eschewing the bike path for the higher speeds of
the main road, we made Bludenz by 6:30pm, where I made my way to the
B&B we stayed at 4 years ago, but alas, the lady who ran it must have
retired from the business and I no longer recognized any of the names
in the apartments.
<p>
So we went on by following the signs to Hotel Val Blu, which turned
out to be a sports resort hotel. The furnishings looked like they came
out of Ikea and the color scheme looked like someone went crazy with
Google colors but didn't have any common sense. To top it off the
bedchamber had a window into the shower, which in turn had a window
into the toilet. We were amused as heck.
<p>
<h1 align=center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/piaw.na/TourOfTheAlps2007Edited/photo#5088394737292641234"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/piaw.na/Rp2cDdlLg9I/AAAAAAAABp8/PJRBJVMPNtI/s144/P1010052.JPG" /></a></h1>
<p>
We were too worn to risk the rain from walking back downtown in the
rain, so we settled for a poor dinner in the hotel restaurant.
