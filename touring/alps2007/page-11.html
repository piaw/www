<h2>Day 11: Karrersee to Canazei (60km, 1500m)</h2>
<p>
After eating all the bread we had with us, we rode over Costalunga
pass and immediately started the short 10km to Vigo di Fassa, in the
Fassa Valley. The Fassa Valley was quite touristed, with lots of
traffic but also a grocery store. We saw a lot of cyclists, mostly day
riders, but also a couple on loaded mountain bikes who didn't look a
day over 15.
<p>

<p>
By the time we got to Canazei I was eager to find a stop for a couple
of nights. The tourist information center gave us a bunch of hotels
and apartments to check out, but I noticed a section of town that was
restricted traffic (residents only), and we decided to focus our
search there. The first hotel we talked to offered us about 28 Euros a
night including breakfast. The room looked acceptable, so we took it.
<p>
Having dumped our lugguage, Mike and I decided to scout out Pordoi
(2239m) and Sella (2244m) while Roberto explored the town. We tried
Pordoi first, and got to the top and ate lunch there. The weather
looked iffy, but in retrospect we should have kept going and done the
full Sella Circuit. Instead we descended and went up Sella, which was
just a bit steeper than Pordoi, enough so that I thought I bonked while
going up it. Having satisfied our need to do that much riding today,
we descended and met up with Roberto before showering and going to
dinner.
<p>
The grey look of the sky did not put Canazei in a flattering light,
but Roberto had found an internet cafe and I dropped by the Pharmacy
to buy some skin cream to keep my bed bug bites from itching too
badly. We also managed to get Italian SIM Cards for our cell phones
just before dinner, which was an unimpressive meal in all respects and
utterly forgettable.
