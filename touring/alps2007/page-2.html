<h2>Day 2: Sarnen to Rosenlaui (75km, 2358m)</h2>
<p>
I woke everyone up around 6:00am, and we rode off to the Zurich HQ to
drop off lugguage we didn't need, and then to the train station to buy
train tickets for Sarnen (27 CHF + bike fare). The train ride was
pleasant and typically fast, with a switch in Luzern. From Sarnen
train station we quickly found the side road towards Flueli-Ranft, and
immediately started climbing under the cool shade of roadside
trees. The road went up at a pretty good grade, but we were
enthusiastic at being on our bikes and quickly rode to Ranft, where we
couldn't find the path to Melchtal but a local cyclist pointed the
sign (which had been obscured by several tourist buses and a gaggle of
tourists) out to us.
<p>
The day had quickly warmed up (or perhaps it was the grade), and we
filled up our waterbottles at a public restroom and proceeded along
the sign. The narrow road quickly became a path with a gentle grade
and beautiful trees providing shade from the sun. The sound of rushing
water was nearby, and gaps in the woods provided us with glimpses of
the valley below. The path went over a covered bridge and joined the
main road for a short section to Stockalp, where car traffic was
required to obey timed traffic rules, one hour uphill and one hour
downhill. We arrived just as the road switched from downhill to
uphill, and after waiting for the auto traffic queued up to move out
of the way, proceeded up the steep climb. Here we broke up into
groups, with my brother leading the charge, with me and Mike behind.

<p>
The road was barely narrow enough for a car to pass a cycle side by
side, but fortunately swiss drivers were quite competent and gave us
as much room as possible. As the road gained altitude, the mountains
appeared nearer and nearer. After some time, I started seeing downhill
traffic, indicating that we had been climbing for more than an hour,
and shortly after that arrived at the town of Frutt. At Frutt, we
organized ourselves and bought a grocery store lunch, bread, cheese,
meat, and potato chips, all of which tasted very good. The sun was
warm but whenever the wind blew up the hill we were chilled, so I put
on arm and leg warmers and a jackets.
<p>
After lunch, we rode on up to the Melchsee, pictures of which had been
sent back from a <a
href="http://www.stefan-burkhardt.net/PHOTOGRAPHY/2007_06_03-GENTAL_TANNALP_SELECTED/gental_to_tannalp.html">prior
scouting trip</a> by Stefan Burkhardt, our friend in Zurich. It was
those pictures which led to us choosing this route, and the pictures
did not do the beauty of the area justice. With a gentle tailwind and
the uphill, we quickly warmed again, and took off the layers we had
just put on.
<p>

<p>
At Tannalp, there was a sign to Englestalp in agreement with a
photocopy of a topo map Stefan had given me, but we got quickly turned
around on the trail and went the wrong way. We had not gone more than
a kilometer or so before some hikers told us we were on the wrong
trail, however, and the hiking and bike pushing began in earnest once
we'd found the right trail.
<p>
The surrounds was beautiful, and I can see why Jobst chose to start
his tour in this fashion every year. The hiking trail was barely
manageable (and too hard for me to consider riding, though I might
change my mind if I had a mountain bike). We traversed several
interesting obstacles, including an electrical cattle fence, a
turnstile, and I am glad we did so in this direction since pushing the
bike downhill was enough of a chore, and going up with a loaded bike
would have been a pain.
<p>
Near Englestalp, the trail became ridable again and I finished the
last km or so with style. Once in Englestalp, we regrouped and
descended the Gental with few incidents (other than a calf wandering
onto the road) and met up with the Susten highway. A misleading bike
sign pointed us towards a mountain bike path to Inertkirchen, but
after asking a local man we turned around and descended along the
road. From Innertkirchen, we rode up the three hairpins of the Kirchet,
and stopped at the Lammi Restaurant for ice-cream.
<p>
Thus recharged, we immediately went up the steep road towards
Rosenlaui. It being a Sunday there was no question that we would stay
there instead of Zwirgi. In the late afternoon sun, it was a little
warm but once we got into shade the going was easier, and my brother
once again pushed the pace, arriving at Zwirgi long enough to wait for
everyone else to show up.
<p>
The was an annoying amount of downhill traffic as hikers and weekend
visitors dropped down from the mountain in platoons of cars sometimes
as many as a half dozen each. By the time we arrived at Rosenlaui
valley, however, most of the worst traffic was behind us and we could
contemplate the beautiful valley and the glacier, stopping to take
pictures. Arriving at <a href="http://www.rosenlaui.ch/">Hotel
Rosenlaui</a> (1330m), we took 2 rooms at 105 CHF a person, including
dinner and breakfast. When Roberto arrived he looked at the distance
and climbing we had done for the day, and said, "I hate to say this,
but I wish we had the Piaw ratio back." Our training rides had been
mostly at 100 feet per mile, and we were well beyond that.
<p>

<p>
We settled into what would become our classic tour pattern: showers,
washing clothes, hanging them up to try, dinner, and rapidly to sleep.
