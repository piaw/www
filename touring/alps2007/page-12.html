<h2>Day 12: Canazei to Canazei (14.5km, 453m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up to rain too heavy to contemplate riding. But around 11:00am
it let up and a bit of sun came out, despite the ominous forecasts we
had seen. We ate lunch down the street, and got into our bike duds to
start climbing up to Sella to attempt the Sella circuit. Drops of rain
were immediately felt the minute we started riding, and 7km up the
hill hail started coming down. We immediately turned around and
descended into stinging painful hail at 60kph to try to get back to
the hotel before things got too bad.
<p>
In the hotel, we dried off, took warm showers to warm up, and
contemplated the day. Roberto came up with the idea to use the hair
dryer to dry off the shoes, while Mike hit his head one too many times
in the arch between the room and its attached bathroom and declared
that he would wear his helmet in the room, even in bed.
<p>
We were all quite sick of Canazei by the end of the day, and hoped for
good weather the next day so we could ride out of here. Then came the
evening alpen glow and all looked right with the world once more.
