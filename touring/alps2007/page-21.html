<p>
Friday morning brought us beautiful sunshine and a clear blue sky,
free of any clouds. From the front steps of the hotel, the glaciers of
nearby mountains were so bright they looked like they should blind you
momentarily when you looked at them.
<p>
From Goschenen, the 5km descent into Wassen (916m), which I had done twice
before was both familiar and easy, and there we stopped to put on
sunscreen and begin the climb. I took the time to ask Mike about the
bill he paid this morning and discovered that we were overcharged by
50CHF. It was too late to do anything about it now, but it was
nevertheless a sour note.
<p>
Sustens pass road is the canonical example of swiss road
engineering. With a sustained, consistent grade of 8%, and a sweeping
climb to the summit tunnel, the views gradually open up along the
valley, and the sounds of cowbells accompany your ascent into what
seems like the clouds. There are those who complain that Sustens is
boring and depressing because you can see the pass from far away
(18km), but I am not one of them. On the first nice day in a while, we
were passed by many many cyclists, until we rode through the summit
tunnel (2224m) and took pictures of ourselves against a snow bank as a
backdrop.
<p>

<p>
Then the descent began. I don't have pictures of the Sustens descent
because it is too important to enjoy the experience to spoil it with
stops and pictures. Even my inadequate brakes were unable to spoil
this jewel of the descent, requiring me to slow down more than usual
through the tunnels and a few hairpins. The exhilarating descent takes
you past glaciers, through tunnels where water drips down on you, past
waterfalls whose spray cool you, and of course down to the Haslital
where Inertkirchen greeted us. There, we stripped down again, and
climbed up over the 3 hairpins of Kirchet (709m), where we stopped for
lunch at Lammi.
<p>
I had had their home-made sausage 2 years ago at the Lammi restaurant,
and the memory of the sausage had caused me to order sausage every so
often on this tour, always resulting in disappointment. This time I
ordered sausage with noodles, and was not disappointed.
<p>
Descending Kirchet into Meiringen, we headed towards the
cliffs. Following the road through town, we picked up Swiss bike route
number 9, which warned us of a 5km ride to climb 450m, and then turned
promptly into a gravel and dirt route. The dirt was not too bad, and I
didn't tear a tire this time, since we were climbing, but once it
became pavement, the climb in the sun up to Hohfluh (1150m) became
quite wearing. From there, we joined the main road down to the Brunig
pass (1002m) where we descended to first the Lughensee (752m), Giswil
(485m), and then Sarnen (471m) where we got weary of the traffic and
got back onto the train to Zurich, reversing the journey we made so
many days ago.

<p>
We got to the office in time for the Friday evening socializing, and
then rode to Rickterswil from Zurich drafting Stefan in the sunny and
warm afternoon.
