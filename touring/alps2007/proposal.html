<p>Last year, Mike Samuel and I did a tour of the French Alps. (see
<a href="http://touring.piaw.net/alps2005/index.html">http://touring.piaw.net/alps2005/index.html</a> for all the gory
details) We thoroughly enjoyed it, and so are planning a trip in 2007
to see the Italian and Austrian Alps. This will probably be the last
installment of my tour of the Alps series since I anticipate
exhausting the rest of the Alps that I haven't seen on this trip. (The
Pyrenees beckon)

Do not read further if:
<ol>
<li>You need to know where you're going to sleep every night.
<li>You need SAG support on a tour.
<li>You're unwilling to carry your own lugguage (unless, of course, you
talk someone else into carrying your lugguage for you)
<li>Adventure isn't really your thing.
<li>Riding off-pavement scares you
</ol>
<p>
The basic idea is to start around the last week of June (when most of
the passes open) in Google's Zurich office, using the July 4th long
weekend to provide more riding time. The idea is to ride a circuit of
the Swiss Alps in the classic areas near Interlaken, make our way to
South-Eastern Switzerland, and then attack the high passes of Italy,
including many of the classic climbs in the Giro D'Italia.
<p>
As with last year, we'll use the British OCD (http://www.ocd.org.uk/)
 Italy guide. We will start with climbing Grosse Scheidegg to Hotel
Rosenlaui. (This is approximately a 14-15% grade, an excellent way to
shake off jet-lag) From Rosenlaui, we'll climb over to Grindelwald,
then descend the Lauterbrunnen valley into Interlaken and then
traverse Grimsel and Furka passes for a grand total of 10000' of
climbing on the second day to Hospental. From there, we'll make our
way over to Chur via another couple of passes and then make our way
into the St. Moritz area. Once there, we're a hop away from Italy and
will explore as much of the Italian Alps as possible, with a possible
excursion to the Dolomites if it's convenient.
<p>
With a week left, we'll ride into Austria, and ride a number of
little-known passes, and end up returning to Switzerland through
Silvretta pass, which is notable for its 60 miles of descent into
Lichtenstein, most of which is on bike paths! I've found that on a 21
day tour, if you plan about 14 days, you'll have room for unexpected
events (such as a fantastic B&B that makes you want to stay an extra
day) and weather while still having the flexibility to do extra
exploring if that moves you.
<p>
I'm expecting to ride about 60-80 miles a day with about 5000-10000'
of climb. If you can do the Sequioa Century (100 miles, 9000') in 10
hours or less before this should be no problem --- I'm getting slower
with age. You should also be comfortable with mild off-pavement
riding, such as that found at the top of Montebello Road or Bohlman
road or the Los Gatos Creek trail. Costs would be around $75 a day a
person for double-occupancy, depending on the level of accomodations
you want and how much/where you eat, and whether you take any trains.
(Trains were by far the most expensive part of our trip, so I'd really
like to avoid that as much as possible --- if we succeed then the
costs might be reduced, but the Euro has also gone up since our visit
in 2005, so it'll probably be a wash) There'll be no SAG support
(those tours cost $200 a day minimum), so expect to fix your own
flats. Accomodations wil be found as we go except for the first day's
accomodations --- my experience was that we always found some place to
stay. I know enough German to get rooms, etc, and will probably be
cramming Italian.
<p>
If you've read this far and are still interested, e-mail me.  You'll
have a say in where the trip goes, of course. I have a maximum group
size of 4 in mind (including myself) but won't be disappointed if
nobody else wants to come along. Plane tickets are cheapest around
September/October, so if you wait until the last minute to buy those,
you may not be able to get them or you may find them
prohibitively expensive (hence I'm planning the trip now). Before you
commit to the trip, you should ride a bit with me, and we should do an
overnight trip somewhere so we can make sure we can get along. Once
you commit, you should be prepared to train, more details of which
will be in the information packet I put together for those who want to
come along. Don't worry --- Mike will assure you that the training
rides are fun!
