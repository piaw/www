<h2>Day 7: Zernez to Hotel Franzenshoehe (79.8km, 2141m)</h2>
<p>
At breakfast, my brother announced that he was abandoning the tour ---
he wasn't having fun, and he was sore. "I'm developing 6-pack abs," he
said, "That's not a good thing." This comment prompted Roberto to say,
"I'll have whatever he's smoking." We weren't happy to see him go, but
his decision made a few things easier: his saddlebag went to Mike, who
could abandon his backpack. A ton of equipment got redistributed, and
my brother headed over to train station with his bike as we headed
back to town to the Ofenpass turnoff.
<p>
I had optimistically thought that we might make Bormio today, as from the map it
looked like Ofenpass was an easy climb of only 600m. There was a false summit at
Il Fuorn as the road turns into Switzerland's first National Park. The descent
was gentle and beautiful, as was the road surroundings, but by the time we got
to the summit we had made well over 900m of climbing.
<p>
At the top of the pass, Roberto and Mike saw cowbells that said
Ofenpass on them, and each bought one, tying the bells to their bikes,
making a tinkling sound any time they stood up or pedalled hard. With
the sound cowbells ringing in our ears, we crossed over the border to
Italy at Taufers, an unremarkable event only punctuated by Italian
officers waving us through.

Both the OCD guide and other individuals had emphasized to us the
importance of approaching Stelvio from the East, so rather than make a
beeline for it via Umbrialpass, we headed for Glorenza for lunch,
stopping only at an ATM to pick up Euros. At Glorenza, we ate at a
modern hotel, and then picked up a bike path signed for Merano and
Prato Allo Stelvio. After about 20 minutes of riding, the signs for
Prato Allo Stelvio disappeared and I became suspicious. Heading off
the bike path for the main road, I asked for directions to Stelvio,
and was pointed in a different direction for the bike path. It turned
out that we turned off the bike path just in time to avoid a lengthy
detour.
<p>
Past Prato Allo Stelvio, the pass road is a straight gentle grade
along a roaring river, which provided welcome cooling in the warm
afternoon sun. Mike, without the burden of wearing a backpack became
2mph faster on the climb and quickly went ahead. We knew we were in
cycling territory when an unloaded woman cyclist passed us saying
"Hi." I knew better than to chase an unloaded cyclist, but when her
companion came by at a slower pace I matched my pace with her and
started a conversation.
<p>
Inga and her friends were from the Netherlands on a cycling
vacation. Their base camp was at the bottom of their hill, along with
their 1 year old kids. Inga worked at a science publication company,
and apparently she and her girlfriends took a week a year for cycling,
camping out at various places and doing day rides. "We're not so fast
any more now that we have kids," she said. I told her we were going to
the Dolomites and asked for recommendations. She thought for a bit and
said, "Passo Pordoi for its beauty." We were heading in that
direction, so I informed her we would give it a try.
<p>
Just before the town of Trafoi (1543m), the famous fifty hairpins of Stelvio
started up, with signs denoting the turn number at each corner. This was the
turnaround point for Inga and her friend, so we waved goodbye and went on. I had
had trouble with the ATM earlier, and opted to try again at Trafoi, this time
successfully extracting a few notes from the machine. The OCD guide had
mentioned a <a href="http://www.franzenshoehe.com/">hotel at the 22nd hairpin of
Stelvio</a>, and Inga had assured me that the tourist season had not started
yet, so that gave us courage to ride higher up the mountain.
<p>
Past Trafoi it became obvious why everyone told us to approach Stelvio
from the East. Views of the overhanging glaciers and the Ortles made
this a delightful climb. Unfortunately, this beauty also seemed very
popular with motorcyclists as well, as the incessant buzz of engines
indicated all through the afternoon. Nevertheless, it is more
pleasurable to share the road with motorcyclists than with SUVs and
monster trucks, despite the appalling number of "Don't kill yourself
on a motorcycle signs" that seemed to decorate the mountain pass roads
of Italy.
<p>

<p>
As we counted down the hairpins, the sun disappeared behind clouds and
the wind picked up. By the time I got to hairpin 22, Mike had already
gone in to check the price for a room: 45 Euros a night. I was going
to comment on that being expensive when Mike said, "Oh yeah, that
includes dinner." That seemed like a really good deal to me, so I told
him to take it if the rooms looked decent.
<p>
The rooms looked more than decent. Clean, with a shower each, a sauna,
and a swimming pool. Mike & Roberto decided to put me into an
isolation chamber where I wouldn't disturb anyone with my
snoring. Dinner was served at an unusually late 7:30pm, so after
showers and washing we killed time a bit by playing a few board games
in the lounge. I tried to go around back to use the clothes lines to
dry my clothes but when the hotel manager saw me attempt that she took
my clothes and assigned them to the hotel's washer. They would hang
dry my clothes and finish it off with some time in a drying machine
before returning them to me.

<p>
Dinner was excellent as well, a fixed price four-course meal that
delighted us all with the exception of the fish. I retired almost
immediately to a deep sleep, though the high altitude meant that I
would wake up less rested than in the recent past.
