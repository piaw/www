<h2>Day 21: Zurich to  Zurich (5km,  0m)</h2>
<p>
I spent the day at the office, catching up with e-mail, seeing
familiar faces in a new environment, and generally enjoying being warm
and dry. Outside, it drizzled and was overcast, but didn't rain too
hard.
<p>
I did ask Thomas Stricker, one of the other cyclists at work about a
good local ride to do on Saturday. He gave me a few suggestions. I
caught up with e-mail, spent some time writing reports and wrestling
with some programming issues, and after TGIF, went to dinner with a
couple of Googlers and their friends. I wanted to get up early,
however, so opted not to join them in the movie.
