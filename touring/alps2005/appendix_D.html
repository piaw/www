<h2>Appendix D: Maps and Guidebooks</h2>
<p>
For the Northern French Alps, I used an old yellow 1:200,000 scale
Michelin map for the Rhone Alps. The 1:200,000 scale is ideal for
tourists, and these maps had a lot of detail, including elevations of
towns, passes, and train tracks. I was saddened to discover that these
have been replaced by the Orange 1:275,000 series, which is what we
ended up using for the Provence Alpes/Cote D'Azur (Map #527). These
have much less detail and are less usable for cycle tourists. (Lesson:
I should have bought up an entire set of the yellow maps back when
they were available!) I did find the Kummerly+Frey 1:180,000 scale
map of Provence/Cote d'Azur (#15), which shows the roads in great
detail, but unfortunately does not have elevation information for
towns. Nevertheless, I would recommend the Kummerly+Frey maps over any
of the Michelins at this point. Mike also bought a bike touring map for
the area, but in my brief perusal of it I found it exceedingly hard to
read.
<p>
For Italy, we used the Kummerly+Frey #1 for Italy: Val
d'Aoste-Piedmont at the 1:200,000. This is a great map of the area and
one I would not hesistate to recommend.
<p>
For Switzerland, I used the 2nd edition (1996)
of <i>Strassenkarte der Schweiz</I> which come at the ideal scale of
1:200,000. It might be hard to find at this point, however. There are
1:300,000 maps of Switzerland that have good detail and are quite
usable, however, so that is less of a concern.
<p>
As usual, for cycle tourists I recommend that you eschew the usual
lonely planet guides and go straight to the <a
href="http://www.ocd.org.uk">OCD</a> series of guides. They are worth
their weight in gold, and well worth the hassle of getting a cashier's
check and registering as a member. For the Alps, these, together with
Jobst's <a
href="http://www-math.science.unitn.it/Bike/Countries/Europe/Tour_Reports/Tour_of_the_Alps/">Tour
of the Alps</a> reports will suffice. Those with hybrids or an
off-pavement bias might also wish to join the <a
href="http://www.rsf.org.uk/">Rough Stuff Fellowship</a> as well, but
judging by what they consider "easy", the OCD guide's references
should more than suffice.
