<h2>Day 7: Briancon to  Le Rauffes (67km,  1445m)</h2>
<p>
The morning found us both refreshed by the nights sleep, though we
were still hungry from the inadequate feeding the night before. We
hurriedly packed, moved downstairs, and found breakfast to be the
usual fare of bread, spread, and hot chocolate. After eating
everything on the table we were once again ready to move on.
<p>
Getting our bikes out, we rolled down towards the new town, following
signs to the Col D'Izoard (2361m). When the Col began it was almost
disappointing, because it looked so much like any other road in the
suburbs. Replacing helmets with caps made it look much better, as the
road quickly rose, granting us good views of Briancon and its
surroundings. After we passed the big manor that I had mistaken for
old town Briancon the day before, the road started dipping and weaving
along side a river that once again told us that we were going to
someplace high. As we climbed, there was sign after sign telling us
that the road was closed, but since several motorcycles passed us we
felt safe ignoring the signs.
<p>
The rest of the climb <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_0962.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_0962.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT></a> was beautiful and not too long,
since Briancon is at 1330m, and but we reached the top feeling
residual tiredness from the day before. There was a little kiosk, and
we bought some water, since we didn't know how far it would take
before we would get some, but we didn't need to bother. There was a
line across the road, but motorcycles crossed it without any trouble,
so we presumed the road was open and descended, right into some
construction which we got around as the construction crew directed
us. Beyond that, the descent would be car free, which let us take the
corners extremely quickly until we got to La Chap, where we bought ice
cream before resuming the descent into Guillestere (1090m).
<p>
Once in Guillestre, we found a supermarket that was opened, and guess
whose bikes were parked outside but our friends Allain & Jean!
Excited, we went in and bought lunch, sunscreen, another bottle of
shampoo (since we had left the shampoo bottle in Briancon), and agreed
quickly to join them for a picnic lunch. Allain & Jean pointed me at a
British cyclist who I might be able to ask about various passes, and
he told me that Col de Bonnette wasn't a very good climb, while Col de
la Cayolle was beautiful, with shade at the bottom, which sounded very
much like the ideal thing. Like the others, he had no experience with
the rough stuff pass I wanted to do, which was Col du Parpaillon.
<p>
Allain & Jean had asked around and found a park with a little bit of
shade, water, and even a WC. We sat around eating lunch, which was
cottage cheese, bananas, bread, and meat. Allain asked us when we
started this morning and we said around 8:30. They said they'd started
at 7. We asked if they did Alp D'Huez, and they said no. We told them
that we were pretty tired from yesterday's ride, and Col de Vars
wasn't really recommended by the OCD guide, so we going to ride
towards Embrun and do Col du Parpaillon. Upon hearing that, Jean
perked up, and started talking. Apparently, here was someone that's
done it before! It turned out that he had done it years before in a
car. He reminded me that the road was unpaved (yes, I knew that), and
told me that there was a tunnel at the top (which I didn't know
about). He said it was probably best done with a mountain bike (well,
I knew that), but I made a pushing motion which told him that i was
willing to get off and push the bike as necessary.
<p>
Allain dug into his stash of maps, and surprise of surprises, he had a
photocopy of a hiking scale (1:100000) map of the Embrun area which
had Col du Parpaillon on it, along with the dirt road fully marked. He
generously gave me the map, seeing that he wasn't going that way
himself. We finished lunch and went on our way, never to see our
French friends again. I gave Allain my card and hoped he would send me
e-mail later.
<p>
We rode down to the national highway towards Embrun. Traffic was
heavy, but after only a kilometer I spotted a turnoff towards
St. Andre D'Embrun. Looking at the road, we decided that it might have
a little bit more climbing, but the lack of traffic would be worth
it. As we turned onto the small one-lane road, we found the climbing
delightful along small houses, farms, with occasional rolled up
haystacks sitting in fields. The warm summer made us appreciate the
occasional tree. Looking across the river at the main road, I realized
that we didn't actually do any extra climbing, but had a beautiful
view and little traffic.
<p>
After winding through little towns for awhile, Mike & I agreed that
we'd try to find something preferably along the route, rather than
descending to Embrun and then riding back up. So at the next Gite (at
Miel) I asked for Mike to stop while I went in to see if there was
room. The proprietor was someone who spoke English fortunately, and he
told me that they were no vacancies. However, at Les Rauffes (a town
so small it wasn't even on the map Allain gave us) further up ahead
(and exactly along our route) there was a Gite called "Le Grande
Ferme", which could possibly take us. He drew us a little map, and
told us that it was a restaurant as well.
<p>
We rode in that direction, and sure enough, found a sign pointing to
"Le Grande Ferme", along with directions. Ominously enough, there was
also a sign for Col du Parpaillon, along with a closed sign hung on
it. Following the directions led us down a tiny road and we eventually
came across a large stone building with chairs outside <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_0972.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_0972.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a> with the Gite
symbol that didn't look open. Mike and I left our bikes there and
walked in through a door, up some stairs, and then opened another door
on the left that looked someone like an office. There, a swarthy
French gentleman name Thierry greeted us. "Do you have a room for 2
people?" "I don't know, let me check.... Ah, yes, I have a room, now
let me talk to my woman and make sure it is OK." He smiled. In a
little bit, he came back, and said, "It's OK. Let me show you your
room." We followed him along a maze of passages and it opened up into
a room in a basement but with natural light coming in through a side
winow. "OK?"  "Yes, we'll take it!"  "It's not ready right now but
will be in an hour or so." He then showed us upstairs, where he
pointed out a place in the building where we could keep the bikes, and
then showed us the garden, complete with lawn chairs we could lie down
on under a cherry tree. "You're welcome to pick the cherries and eat!"
I asked him about the signs below that indicated that Col du
Parpaillon was closed. He said, "Let me call the next village and
ask." A few minutes later: "There is ice in the tunnel on the top, but
I think it should be OK."
<p>
Finally, he showed us the cellar <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_0971.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_0971.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT></a>, a cool beautiful place
that just stunned me. I asked for a photograph right there. I asked
about Col du Parpaillon, and he said he'd call to the next village,
which he did almost immediately with the response, "There's ice in the
tunnel, but I think it should be OK." We then our bikes in the
appropriate parking spaces, and went to sit in the garden with the
cherry trees <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_0973.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_0973.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a>, SMS'd Lisa, eating cherries as I went. I was delighted to
find such a lovely place. The views of Embrun and the lake right next
to it were nothing short of gorgeous.
<p>
When our room was ready, we went in, took a shower, washed our clothes
and then hung them out to dry. We hung out a bit,and then I realized I
hadn't asked about dinner. I went down to meet Thierry again, and
asked him when dinner was served in the restaurant. He looked startled
and said, "No, the restaurant has been closed for 8 months!" "The sign
down there still said, Restaurant." "I painted out one sign but didn't
do the other sign." "Is there another restaurant in town?" "No." He
looked at me again, "You're cyclists. I'll make something for
you. Anything you like to eat?" "We'll eat anything, we're not
picky. Thank you very much." "I'll come get you around 7:30 or so."
<p>
I gave Mike the good news, then went back to sit under the cherries
again. A storm was brewing and the wind blew hard. I hoped that would
dry out our clothes faster, but with the increasing humidity I thought
it was a lost cause. Nevertheless, it was fun watching the clouds move
and the wind did occasionally pick a ripe cherry and drop it down onto
my lap. When 7:00pm came around I took all the clothing off the
clothes-lines and hung it back in our room.
<p>
When the call to dinner came, we went downstairs and sat down in the
porch that we saw when we first came. He first served us bread with
park pate, and we ate all the pate. Then came the tabouleh, a rice starter,
which we did not make that much headway into. Finally a huge bowl of
pasta, and the best roasted wild duck I had ever had in my life. The
food was great and there was lots of it. When everything was finished,
a big bowl of cherries came out, but we had already stuffed ourselves
with cherries, so we left that untouched and went back to our rooms
and slept the sleep of the tired.
<p>
On this trip, we frequently saw folks who were on fully supported
tours, riding up the mountains without a load. I would not be honest
if I didn't say that there are moments when if I could pay money for
someone else to carry my load I would. But the truth is, finding a
beautiful country Gite, a road that wouldn't appear on any guided
tour's itinerary, and the adventure of doing whatever we wanted to,
whenever we wanted to is what makes everything we do worthwhile, and
this day (and the next) are the highlights that I will remember year
after year. I'm not publishing any phone #s or addresses for Le Grande
Ferme --- the last thing I want is to have Le Grande Ferme turn into
another Hotel Rosenlaui, where I <b>have</b> to make reservations even
to get dorm accomodations. But if you are going there by bicycle, feel
free to contact me and I will tell you where it is.
