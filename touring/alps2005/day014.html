<h2>Day 14: St Christophe to  Martigny/Hospental (94km,  1935m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up to an ominous looking sky <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1076.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1076.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT></a>, packed our bags
quickly, and then went downstairs looking for breakfast. No one was in
sight, so we mounted our saddlebags and handlebar bags, and then
walked around. There was someone in the kitchen, and when we mentioned
breakfast to him, he went up to the front desk, gave us bread and a
cup of cappuchino. Mike paid for our stay, and he gave us directions
to Grand St Bernard.
<p>
I had done this approach two years ago, but still did not remember how
to properly negotiate the area around Aosta. We rode along the main
highway until the first turn off, and then got lost a few times on
city streets, asking for directions every so often until we found
ourselves on the highway to the tunnel, which was shared with cars and
big trucks. The lower part of the climb is an easy grade, but that
day, a strong headwind developed and I was forced to draft Mike. There
was one point at which even Mike was wobbled by the strength of the
sidewind, which made me glad that I had him to draft. I would not have
enjoyed doing this climb by myself.
<p>
At this point, there was still blue sky, so I hoped that the blustery
conditions did not portend something worse. We stopped after about
10km to pick up sports drinks, and another 3km after that to buy
bananas, which I stuck in my pocket. We would use Gu most of the day
today, but having solid food is always a morale booster that I
enjoy. The sports drinks were probably superflous, since the day was
unusually cool, but it never hurts to replace electrolytes.
<p>
We rode rapidly past the town of Etrouble (1270m), which was followed
by a retrograde over to St. Oyen, past which we started to see signs
for the fork off between the main tunnel bypass and the secondary road
which would take us to the top. Past the fork at St Rhemy en Bosses
(1619m), we started feeling quite cold, so stopped to put on arm and
leg warmers. The climb wound around a little bit before starting the
steep section up a wooded section that was beautiful. <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1086.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1086.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a> At
this point, Mike said, "This is my last climb, so I'm going to climb
it at maximum effort."  There was no way I could keep up with him if
he did that, so we parted ways. I was sad to lose my wind-shield, but
it also meant that I was more likely to take pictures.
<p>
I slowly worked my way up the wooded area along the tunnel highway,
and then stopped at the last cafe before the top to eat a banana and
take pictures. Lisa & I had stopped 2 years ago here for water, but
there would be no need for that today since it was so cool. As we
climbed further, the clouds appeared to hang lower and lower while I
got colder and colder. Eventually I gave in and stopped again to eat
Gu and put on everything I had.  A headwind rose up in the North and I
started having to fight to make progress. Finally, after a long
construction area where traffic was one-way every few minutes, I
approached what I remembered to be the summit. The wind at this point
was around 30kph. The summit (2473m)? It was foggy, and I could see perhaps 1
meter of the summit lake. There was no sign of Mike.
<p>
I rode past the Italian customs post and was stopped at the Swiss
customs post. The Swiss asked to see my passport, and I took the
opportunity to ask them if they had seen another cyclist ride by. They
hadn't. After getting my clearance, I turned around and went to look
for Mike. There was a cyclist who passed us about 30 minutes before
the summit, and I saw him there putting his bike into a car driven by
his wife. I asked them if they had seen my friend, and his wife said
yes, 5 minutes ago. I concluded that Mike must have descended so I
rode over to the Swiss side, and there behind a building swapped my
cap for a helmet next to a motorcyclist who although dressed in heavy
leathers complained about the cold while smoking a cigarette.
<p>
The descent was cold! My hands were cold, and had to hang on to the
brake levers, which being metal conducted heat away from my fingers
and made them colder still. Every 5 minutes my fingers would go numb
and I would have to stop and put my hands inside my jersey against my
body in order to warm them up. I repeated this 3 or 4 times before the
grade became gentle enough that I could ride without holding the
brakes. Even then I was shivering with cold on the descent as it
passed through tunnels and galleries. It is a tribute to Swiss drivers
that all through the descent none of them buzzed me, made obscene
gestures or yelled at me.
<p>
The descent went on and on past Orsieres (879m), a town that Lisa & I
had stopped for breakfast before riding up Champex. I stopped when I
saw a restaurant called Le Catogne. Determined that I needed
sustenance, I stopped, placed my bike somewhere prominent, and walked
in. It was such a relief to see a black man with impeccable English
ask me what I would like to drink, to which I replied "Hot water,
please." He looked puzzled walked away, and then came back and asked
if I really meant just hot water. I replied to the affirmative, and he
came back with it. I placed my hands around the cup and enjoyed the
feeling of warmth in my hands and the pleasant sensation.
<p>
My waiter came back and kindly went over the menu with me and I
ordered lunch. I then realized that I could SMS Mike from my cell
phone which I proceeded to do. I tried calling him as well, but it was
useless. Lunch arrived, as did the motorcyclist I had encountered
earlier. When he saw me he came up and commented to me how cold it
was. I agreed and shuddered. I ate lunch with gusto and Mike SMS'd me
right before I completed lunch. I asked Mike where he was and he said
10 minutes from the top. I asked the restaurant how to spell their
name and SMS'd the name of the restaurant to him along with
directions.
<p>
I then sat outside and waited. My motorcyclist acquaintances came by,
and we chatted some more. "You're not too far from Martigny now, and
the temperature was much better, right?" It was only a very light
misty drizzle right now, so I agreed. An English man and his wife went
into the restaurant. After they were seated he must have immediately
come back outside to talk to me, because he appeared right away and
talked to me about my cycle trip. He introduced himself as Barry
Armstrong (no relation to that famous cyclist), and his wife was
Susan. His brother apparently was quite a serious cyclist, hence his
affinity for talking to strange cyclists. I told him I was waiting for
my friend.
<p>
It took a really long time for Mike to show up, and he had to SMS me
another time for directions. By the time he arrived, it was past two
and the kitchen was closed. Barry, however, intervened, and got the
restaurant to grant us a plate of cold meats and bread, and I handed
Mike my last banana, so he ate well. All through lunch Ikept up a
conversation with Barry and Susan. They told me that the weather was
supposed to get better tomorrow and the day after, and offered me a
place to stay if I wanted. My plans were still up in the air, but if
the weather really was good, then I wanted to climb Sustens pass and
visit Rosenlaui, while I was still thinking that visiting my friend in
Lausanne might be possible if the weather was bad, so I declined the
offer. I gave Barry my card, and told him to send me e-mail.
<p>
When Mike finished lunch, we said our farewells to the Armstrongs, and
proceeded on our descent. We went 8km before Mike fell behind. I heard
him cry out something, turned around, and rode back to him along the
sidewalk to find htat he had had a snakebite. I had wondered to myself
earlier whether his tire was low or whether it was just because he was
a big guy, and I guess now I knew the answer. Torelli Master rims are
great, except that they are just a bit too big, and hence a pain in
the behind to get tires on and off. I helped Mike with it, and he got
the tire pumped up pretty hard. I gave him one of his unpatched tubes
in order to fix the flat, and took back a patched tube.
<p>
The descent into Martigny (477m) happened without incident, and we found the
train station with no problem. I congratulated Mike on the successful
completion of his first bicycle tour, and then called Jennie. Jennie
declined to host me for a rest day, so my path was set. I would go to
Hospental tonight. The train to Realp, however, didn't run this late,
so I had to take an inter-city train for one stop, hop onto a regional
train, get onto a postal bus, and then finally take the glacier
express one stop to Realp. I would not get to Realp until 8:30pm. (It
was now 5:00pm) The cost? 67 Francs, including the 15 Franc bike
charge. It sounded like a deal.
<p>
I had a little bit of time, so I went back to a bike shop I saw
earlier, borrowed their pump, and pumped up my tires. I then dropped
by a supermarket and bought bananas, gatorade, and chocolate. Given
the long time I would spend on the bus I figured that I would have
plenty of time to eat chocolate on the bus.
<p>
The train ride along Sion valley was beautiful, sun shining through
patches of cloud, granting lovely crepuscular beams over the valley. I
thoroughly enjoyed the views granted by the train. The bus trip was
fun as well (yes, those postal buses have a storage area under the bus
which will happily take a touring bike, complete with saddlebag). But
now the weather turned cloudy and dark. By the time I'd gotten to
Oberwald, I was starting to wonder if it had been a good idea at all!
There was definitely a slight drizzle, and the outlook did not look
pretty. Well, I was set. The rail operator took my bike and put it
into a special baggage van. I then went back to a passenger car.
<p>
The train ride from Oberwald to Realp wasn't very interesting, since
it was one very long tunnel that lasted almost the entire trip. By the
time I got to Realp is was 8:32pm, and I hopped out of the train. The
baggage car rolled open and I was handed my bike. I looked around, and
tried riding out of the gate I was on, but it didn't seem to go
anywhere, so I took the tunnel under the tracks and emerged onto the
road from Realp, which I had ridden from once before, two years ago,
under more pleasant weather conditions.
<p>
The ride down from Realp (1538m) was cold and freezing. There was a gentle
headwind which made the downgrade not as fast but just as cold as it
would have been. After 4km I hit the railroad crossing where the
glacier express was going, and had to stop, along with a couple of
motorcycles that had passed me 2 minutes earlier. A little after that,
there was a construction zone where traffic was one way every few
minutes. After that, however, it was clear sailing and I rode down
onto the main cobblestone street in Hospental and arrived at the Hotel
Rossli where I had stayed 2 years ago. The man at the reception
claimed there was no room, but the woman, who despite not recognizing
me from two years ago told me yes, she'd give me this double room for
50 Francs including a big breakfast. I parked the bike at the usual
place, downstairs and in the back, and brought my bags up to the
room. I asked if dinner was possible and she said, "Yes, but hurry
because we close the kitchen at 9:00pm." I didn't do much except to
take a leak, wash my hands, and bring down my wallet and came down to
dinner quickly.
<p>
Dinner for me was butternut squash soup, a hot broth to brace against
the cold, and some fish along with Swiss standard size Eichoff
beer. After that, there was not much to do except shower, laundry, and
sleep.
