<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>
I visited friends in Lausanne on Sunday, where it was sunny and
beautiful. Walking around and talking to my friends, I felt
different. They had the benefit of being in Europe longer, but I had
seen and experienced a Europe that was completely different. Where
they saw urban landscapes, I saw mountains, countryside. Where they
saw formal cities, I had encountered the informal hospitality of the
rural areas. Where they saw schools and businesses I saw farms,
adventure, weather and terrain. We loved Europe, each in our different
ways, but in many ways I felt more freedom than they did.
<p>
I shall return, to ride the St. Mortiz area, and explore more of the
Austrian alps. Mike is talking about buying a dedicated touring
bike. Steve's ride in Nice went very well.
