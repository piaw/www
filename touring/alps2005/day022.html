<h2>Day 22: Zurich to  Gossau (108m,  1300m)</h2>
<p>
I got out of the house at 8:45, not being in a hurry on an overcast
day to get going. Leaving Zurich, I rode along the North side of the
Zurichsee, viewing the lake as much as I could through built up
developed houses and sites along the lake. The terrain was mostly flat
and I made good time all the way to Rapperswil, even managing to stay
on the wheel of a local rider clocking 33kph along a few rollers. From
Rapperswil I rode along to Eschenbach towards Ricken. At this point
the road moved away from the lake and started a gentle climb.
<p>
Thomas had warned me the Ricken (805m) itself was a significant hill,
but it was only 130m of climbing. At Ricken proper I stopped to ask
for directions and was told to head over to the next town,
Wattwil. There was a signed bike path to Wattwill, but having been led
astray one too many times by bikepaths (and having a descent ahead of
me) I stuck to the main road. At Wattwill, the first intersection
right led me was indicated to be the correct oneby a local cyclist,
and led me right to the bike path back to Wattwill. The same bike
route, however, was also signed for Kappel, Ebnat, and Krummenau.
<p>
This bike route (it wasn't a bike path since I did run into a handful
of cars along it) wound along high in the hills and had extremely
light traffic. I was impressed by how picturesque the area
looked. Staring ahead into the distant hills, however, it seemed to
me that the clouds were hanging quite low. I rolled through Kappel and
Ebnat and at Krummenau exited the bike route and returned to the main
road to Neu St. Johann, where the first intersection was signed for
Schwagalp.
<p>
The road to Schwagalp (1278m) started very steeply for a hill that was only
1100m high, so it was not surprising after 2km that it flattened out
and became a delightful series of rolling hills alongside woods and a
stream. I rolled along for at least 10km before the road again
decisively turned uphill for the finaly climb to Schwagalp. As the
final approach began I saw the granite mountains of the area,
including Santis which rose to 2503m. All the peaks, however were
shrouded by fog. I took to looking at the butts of cyclists who were
descending to find tell-tale stains of a wet summit, but everyone who
came down was dry, giving me hope that I would avoid another wet
descent that day.
<p>
At the top (which wasn't terribly impressive) I put on a jacket and
started a twisty set of hairpins which dropped me 200m to
Rossfall. The descent was very manageable and the traffic very
light. Pretty soon I found myself pedaling against a headwind towards
Urnasch, Waldstatt and Herisau. At Herisau, I stopped for a grocery
store lunch, and then made the descent into Gossau. An Australian
gentleman provided me with directions (and a helpful walkthrough) to
the train station and there I bought train tickets for myself and the
bicycle back to Zurich. My bicycle tour had ended on an easy and dry
note, though it would pour and rain the next 2 days in Switzerland.
