<h2>Day 20: Rickenbach to  Weggis (30km,  0m)</h2>
<p>
The day started out overcast but dry. Breakfast was good and more than
ample. Apparently our complete consumption of everything on the table
the day before had made our hostess think that she did not provide
enough food, so she kept asking us if we had had enough. We nodded and
Steve paid the bill: 100 Swiss francs for 2 nights. When people tell
me that Switzerland is an expensive country from now on I'm going to
assume that they're just trying to stop the huge numbers of tourists
from flocking to the country driving up prices if they really knew how
cheap it really was to stay in Switzerland.
<p>
By the time Steve was finished putzling around, it was 9:00am and the
drizzle had started. We rode back down to Schwyz again this time
following signs for Brunnen. Along the Stattersee I saw a sign for
Gersau that indicated that Gersau had a ferry that took cars!
Intrigued by the possibility of taking a ferry trip I sped up and we
got to the Ferry terminal about 5 minutes after it had left. Feeling a little
dejected we rode on, with the drizzle slowly becoming rain. We rode
past a youth hostel, where two young ladies asked us how far it was to
Gersau in German. I didn't understand what they said, but Steve
figured it out just as they were about to give up in frustration and
speak English!
<p>
Riding past Vitznau the rain became an absolute downpour making
raingear a necessity. We pushed on, not having a choice but not only
did it rain hard it got colder. I was having less and less fun on this
trip! Finally at Weggis we stopped for Steve to use a
bancomat. Looking across the street I saw a shelter that indicated it
was a passenger Ferry! <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1198.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1198.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a> We rode across the street to check it out and a
local Swiss told us that indeed, this Ferry did go to Luzern. I went
into the office to check the price and it was slightly over 20 Swiss
Francs per person with our bikes.
<p>
"It's your choice, Piaw, as to what we do now." "That's it, I'm taking
the Ferry to Luzern." "And then what?" "I'm going to take the train to
Zurich, and go to the office. The office is looking better than this
rain." "Can I work at your office too?" "No, but we'll have internet
access and you can see what parts of Europe isn't shrouded with this
miserable weather."
<p>
There's a saying in cycle touring that the worst day on the bike is
better than the best day in the office. But most folks who say that
don't work at Google. I could have ridden some more (and I have done
so in rainier conditions, in Scotland), but I had had plenty of good
riding when the weather was better, and 3 days of rainy cold descent
was really close to my limit, so the prospect of being dry for a
change looked really good right now.
<p>
Steve, on the other hand, had just arrive not too long ago, had only a
few days left in Europe, and was still raring to go. Well, he could
climb as many cold and rainy passes he liked, but I didn't feel
obliged to do any more wet and rainy passes. 3 bad descents were more
than enough to convince me that I could wait for another year to do
more alpine roads.
<p>
So we ended up in Zurich around 2:30pm. There, Steve went to the
airport and bought a plane ticket to Nice. I took a shower, did
laundry, bought enough chocolate to satisfy folks back home, and
bought a few <a href="http://www.m-gineering.nl/nbtg.htm">NBT2s</a>
for my cycling friends. Steve and I had dinner, where we went over his
possibilities in Nice, and then we said goodbye, never to see each
other again on this trip.
