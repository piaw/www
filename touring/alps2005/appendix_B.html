<h2>Appendix B: Equipment Reviews</h2>

A big thumbs up goes to the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007TJ5AK/qid=1121576640/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-7437365-8983967?v=glance&s=photo&n=507846">Canon
SD500</a>. It withstood the rigors of bike touring, sitting in the
mesh pocket of my <a
href="http://www.deltacycle.com/cargo/hrbag.php">Delta Cycles
handlebar bag</a> most of the time. Once again, my <a
href="http://www.suuntowatches.com/escape.htm">Sunnto Escape
altimeter</a> provided readings that were almost always within 10m of
the summit sign. The Delta cycles handlebar bag suffered a tear from
overloading, but was otherwise ergonomically designed with perfect
pocket placemment for every item that was important. For the price
($25 on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a> new), you could buy a new one for each tour you do, and
spend many years touring happily for the price of a single Giles
Berthoud bag. I could always reach for my camera and shoot without
ever stopping the bike on a climb. Having seen a Giles Berthoud bag in
person, I now consider it nowhere as convenient or useful as the Delta
cycles bag. I think of it this way: would you rather have a useful bag
that lasted about 6 weeks of cycling, or would you have a bag that
lasted forever but made you stop the bike to get anything out of it?
For me the answer is clear. Once again, Carradice saddlebags work
exceedingly well. <a
href="http://www.avocet.com/tirepages/carbon12.html">Avocet 700x25
tires</a> surpassed all my expectations --- as a reference Mike went
from being a nervous, white knuckled descender on continental tires to
a supremely confident fast descender on the Avocet 700x25s. <a
href="http://www.mtbr.com/reviews/Pump/product_86619.shtml">Topeak
Road Morph pumps</a> are similarly recommended.

proved their usefulness on long hot hard bike tours. The effect after
taking two is almost immediate. Every time Mike or I started to cramp
we would take one or two and our symptoms would completely disappear.

Poor experiences came from cantilever brakes. If I had my bike to do
all over again I would build a frame around long reach caliper brakes
instead of cantilevers. They squeal, they don't stop any better, and
are a pain to adjust and replace brake pads. I will never buy a road
touring bicycle with cantilever brakes again. With long reach caliper
brakes as an option there is simply no reason to accept an inferior
solution.

Steve's experience with his Ritchey breakaway demonstrates that no
matter the manufacturer, you <b>must</b> test ride your bike with a
full touring load to check for shimmy before you go touring. There is
no way to predict whether a bike will have shimmy problems, and it's
best to find out before you go. (Not to mention, your frame will have
better resale value if you don't put several hundred miles of rainy
day riding before you try to sell it, which you will have to do if it
shimmys)
