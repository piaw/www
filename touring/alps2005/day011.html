<title>Day 11: Nice to  Tende (85km,  2000m)</title><body>
<h2>Day 11: Nice to  Tende (85km,  2000m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up early, and rode out for some breakfast (needless to say, we
weren't about to pay Radisson prices for breakfast). We also found the
CitySports store which might have some power drinks. While Mike waited
for the store to open, I went back to negotiate (futilely it turns
out) with the hotel about the ridiculous laundry bill.
<p>
By the time I settled everything and came back it was 9:00am, and
CitySports hadn't opened yet. Someone finally told us that it opened
at 10:00am, so we decided that we had to leave now before it got too
hot to climb.
<p>
Mike had not ridden a lot in heavy urban traffic before, so I gave him
a quick course in city riding: "You're the fastest thing in the city
except for a motorbike or scooter, so don't be shy and take a full
lane. Anything a motorbike or scooter can do, you can do as well." We
started out well, navigating our way out of the city towards
Sospel. Unfortunately, when we finally got to the Sospel turn off, it
turned out to be a freeway entrance, forbidden to bikes. The first few
people we asked were of no help, but I spotted a van driver who looked
like he was a professional delivery man, so I asked him, and he
pointed me at a side street which led us to the correctly numbered
highway.
<p>
Soon enough, we were out of Nice and climbing "Col du Nice", a climb
that's considered a part of Col de Braus (1002m) by the OCD, since the descent
was very short and we immediately started the second climb after
stopping in the town for a fountain. The day had heated up
dramatically and we were quite cooked by the time we reached the
summit of Col de Braus. The descent down to Sospel took us almost down
to 300m. We ate lunch in Sospel in the shade, but the heat made me
back off on the food since I knew that the heat along with too much
food would make me sick.
<p>
Climbing Col de Broius (879m) in the afternoon heat was brutal ---
near the top we were overtaken by a fully laden cyclist (front and
rear panniers) along with his girlfriend, who was riding a completely
unloaded bike. They descended ahead of us while we stopped to get our
bearings. From here, the road would descend at a 12% down to 200m
again where we would start our climb to Col du Tende (1871m). I started to
feel the weariness of doing so much work set in, so took the descent
easy, though still fast enough that Mike hung back a bit.
<p>
At the bottom we made a left onto the Tende highway, where traffic
immediately increased. A strong tailwind set in, however, which cooled
us down and pushed us along at 28kph. That did wonders to my
optimism. A long tunnel with fresh tar laid down, however, made my
rear wheel pick up something which punctured my rear tire, so I had to
stop and fix the second flat of the tour. It wasn't fun, since by that
point, clouds had gathered and we once again had the sense of
impending doom. "I don't think we're going to make Col du Tende," I
said. "No, I don't think so either, but I think we can make Tende
itself." I nodded.
<p>
We kept climbing but without a tailwind this time. The temperature had
cooled significantly, and at least we were somewhat sheltered by
impressive looking cliff walls, but with the urgency of the storm
coming up, we could not stop or slow down, just turn the pedals
fast. Eventually, about 5km from Tende it started to rain. We rode to
a railroad bridge and then popped our bikes over the fence to try to
wait it out. "The storm came on so suddenly, maybe it'll blow over
just as quickly," I said, not to convincingly to Mike.
<p>
The storm ebbed and flowed for a bit, and then turned to hail! Pretty
soon it was hailing so hard that even cars were stopped under our
little railroad bridge. The temperature dropped several degrees, and I
started to feel cold. We had some interesting gestured conversations
with some of the drivers who stopped, but none of them could give us a
ride. Fortunately, just before we stopped I had spied a sign that said
"Le Terminus, 2km, Logis De France hotel." Logis De France is a
network of family run hotels in France, and the OCD guide indicated
that they were usually good value, and I was eager to try them. They
were in St. Dalmas de Tende, about 5km south of Tende itself.
<p>
It took more than half an hour, but eventually the hail became rain
again. Well, rain is something we were willing to ride through,
especially for 2km, so we hopped on our bikes and furiously rode
through the next kilometers, stopping only to get a little bit off
course, and then to confirm the directions to the hotel, which was
just a bit further than I had thought.
<p>
The lady who was running Le Terminus saw us and happily gave us a
room, along with dinner and breakfast. As I looked around the room I
unconsciously pulled open my rain jacket to try to remove it, and
ripped the velcro right from the jacket itself, render the jacket now
useless. The room while small, was more than serviceable and a hot
shower very welcome after the cold rain. My shoes and socks were wet,
so after the shower I came down to dinner in bare feet into an elegant
dining room that looked like I should have worn a tuxedo.
<p>
Nevertheless, nobody seemed to be bothered by my footwear (or lack of
it), and dinner was delicious. "Today is the reverse of yesterday:
yesterday we got everything we wanted, but today we got nothing we
wanted, but I'm just as happy I found this place."
<p>
Not having much to do, we did laundry, did our best to dry things out,
and then went to sleep.
