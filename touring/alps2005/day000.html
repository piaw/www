<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>
On Friday, June 17th, Mike Samuel & I flew into Zurich for a Tour of
the French Alps. We flew separately, since we bought our plane tickets
separately on www.hotwire.com, with me flying in on United Airlines at
8:30am, and him later on in the afternoon.
<p>
I went through customs, got my bike which was undamaged despite the
rear deraileur having stuck out through the box, and proceeded to
assemble the bike and place my saddlebag and the handlebar bag on the
bike. I had a backpack that I would leave at the Google apartment in
Zurich, but until I got access to the apartment I would have to ride
with it on.
<p>
It took another half an hour to get a SIM card for my unlocked
Motorola MPX 220 cell phone, and then I found a person to help me buy
train tickets for the Zurich main station. As with most European
countries, the trains in Switzerland took a fully assembled bike
without any trouble. By 10:30 I was at the Zurich main station looking
lost. I had a paper print out of a map of the Google Zurich office,
but without any way to orient myself, I exited on the wrong side of
the train station. I asked a couple of folks who were sitting by the
side of the road how to get to where I wanted to go, and they pointed
me at the road around the train station and I went at it.
<p>
Riding around a strange town jet-lagged is an andrenaline inducing
experience. On the one hand, it's exciting --- the sights and sounds
of a city aren't what I'm used to on my daily commute. On the other
hand, the stress of not knowing where I was headed weighed heavily on
my shoulders --- or was it the backpack?
<p>
I eventually hit a river with a road name I didn't recognize. I asked
another cyclist and showed her the map, and she told me to turn right,
and turn right again at the next block, find this big street, and then
turn left. I did as she told me to do, and after that saw the number 6
tram which the folks at the office told me to look for, and followed
that down a few blocks before realizing that I could ride past the
street I was looking for and not notice if I was blindly following the
tram, so I got off my bike and walked. Sure enough the next street was
what I was looking for, so I turned right and pushed the bike up the
hill until I saw the Google logo. It took me a couple of minutes to
figure out how to open the door with my badge, and then I was in!
<p>
I dropped my bike off alongside several other bikes, and then
proceeded up the stairs, where I had a full day of work waiting for
me, including giving a tech talk, having a couple of technical
discussions with folks that I would normally have a hard time working
with, and getting the key to the apartment, which I would share with
Mike and Rajul. Avieta told me that the week before it had been
thunderstorming, so I must have brought good weather with me from
California.
<p>
At 3:00pm, Mike called the office to say that he had missed his
connection at Frankfurt and would not be there till late. This was bad
news, since the bike might or might not have missed the
connection. (He late explained that he was so jet-lagged that he
completely missed the fact that his plane was loading passengers!)
<p>
I was running completely on adrenaline, which meant everything went
well until the urgency of trying to do everything today faded, which
meant that at 4:30pm, I started to feel really really tired. <a

volunteered to help by carrying my backpack, gave me directions to the
apartment along with a better map, and I rode to the apartment with no
trouble at all, took a shower, and then we headed out to dinner after
Mike didn't show up.
<p>
While we finished dinner, Mike showed up and announced that Lufthansa
had lost his bike! This was very stressful, and we were both very
agitated. We discussed me visiting my friend in Lausanne at the start
of the trip instead of at the end, or Mike buying a new bike (which
would have been ironic since we had spent 5 hours building him new
wheels just a month before the tour).
<p>
In the end, we decided to wait. Rajul said that the bike would
probably be delivered tonight. I stayed up till about 9:30 and then
gave in and went to bed.
