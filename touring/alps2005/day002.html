<h2>Day 2: Cluses to  Beaufort (93km,  2630m)</h2>
<p>
I slept like a baby all night, and woke up feeling much
refreshed. Mike remarked that he still didn't sleep that well, but
nevertheless was ready to do some serious riding. But first, breakfast
was found at the bakery down the street which we had walked past the
evening before. 2 butter croissants and 2 chocolate croissants (2
Euros) later, we were ready to ride.
<p>
We followed the directions the woman at the tourist information center
gave us the night before, and rode about 5km before Mike had to stop
to adjust his saddlebag, which was sagging onto the tire. Now, Mike is
6' 4", which meant that by all rights his seat height should be so
high that it shouldn't be an issue, but he has two
disadvantages. First, he has a missing calf muscle, which meant that
he set his seat height lower than would be expected for someone his
size. Secondly, he bought a saddlebag adaptor for his saddle, rather
than using a saddle with integrated loops, which costs him some
effective saddle height.
<p>
After the adjustment, we rode on up Col de la Columbiere, which starts
off as a suburban climb and then disappears into the country, giving
us pretty views of mountain villages <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_0817.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_0817.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a> until it tops out at
1613m, where we stopped for pictures and to calibrate my
altimeter. The 600m descent from the Col to St. Jean was rapid and
gave us both a reminder of what descending felt like. At the bottom of
the hill we immediately headed up towards la Clusaz and Col des
Aravis, which at 1486m was an easy climb for us. Near the top of the
Col, I got ahead of Mike because he was having trouble with saddlebag
drag, and waited for a bit before descending to find him just a couple
of switch-backs around the bend. I circled around and stood up to
catch him when I heard a sudden hiss coming from the front. "Mike, I
got a flat!" Mike stopped and I fixed the flat --- mysteriously
enough, the flat seemed to come from inside the rim. What I should
have done then was to put in a new rim tape but in my hurry to get
going again I forgot all about it.
<p>
The top of Col des Arravis had a restaurant and some stalls selling
cow skins, but we decided to forgo that and eat at the bottom of the
hill at Flumet (917m), where right past the fountain we found a pretty good
restaurant that Mike would claim was the best of the trip. I didn't
think of that restaurant as being anything special, but obviously I
should have ordered whatever Mike had.
<p>
The lunch being big and heavy, we went back to the sheltered fountain
to fill our water bottles and take what we thought was going to be a
15 minute nap that turned out to be an hour! When we woke up our bikes
and gear were still there, so we had no choice but to climb the 3rd
Col of the day, Col des Saisies (1633m). Earlier in the day, Mike had
complained about how hot the weather had been. I said to him, "Be
careful or you might just get some rain."
<p>
Sure enough, after a couple of switchbacks on Saisies, we heard some
thunder and then rain followed. The rain was warm, however, so we did
not even bother with rain gear. We did stop, however, so I could
activate the rain cover on my handlebar bag and put a saddle bonnet on
my B-17. Climbing in the rain was safe and relatively easy, and Mike,
being the stronger of the two of us went on ahead. On the way up,
however, I spotted what looked like a good rain shelter, and went in,
sitting there for 10 minutes to try to out wait the rain. When the
rain went from a shower to a drizzle I got out and kept riding.
<p>
The top of Col des Saisies wasn't pretty, being mar'd by a ski resort,
among other buildings. Mike was lying down by a sign taking a nap, and
when I asked him how long he waited he said about 10 minutes.
<p>
There wasn't much to do but to descend. I had spotted an alternate
route down on the Michelin map, but decided that we weren't going to
risk it if there was a thunderstorm brewing. Sure enough, we heard a
thunderstorm as we descended the fast twisty road, and took the direct
route down. At the bottom I spotted a hotel and asked if we wanted to
stay there. "How far is Beaufort?" asked Mike. "About 3km," I told
him. "There'll be more choices of restaurants there." We barrelled
through the last 3km and got to the tourist information office
<a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_0842.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_0842.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT></a> to be told that we had a choice of two hotels in town. We
rode down to the first one where we saw a bunch of fully-supported
cycle tourists checkin. Mike found a room (with 3 people) for 57
Euros, and we were worn out enough that we didn't bother checking with
the other hotel. Mike didn't think we'd find another hotel for 57
Euros again for the rest of the trip, but I was pretty sure that good
deals would still be forthcoming.
<p>
I chatted with the tour organizers, and he told me there were 16
cyclists from their trip, all from Britain. They had come over Cormet
de Roseland that day, and Petite Grand St. Bernard the day before
that, and would reverse the route we did today tomorrow. They seemed
pretty impressed that we carried all our own lugguage.
<p>
Dinner was at a pizzeria down the street that turned out to be pretty
bad. I would have bad luck with pizza all throughout the rest of the
trip.
