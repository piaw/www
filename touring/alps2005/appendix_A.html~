<h2>Appendix A: Conclusions</h2>
<p>
I was extremely impressed by how rugged the French Alps was. In 2003,
Lisa & I toured the Austrian and Swiss alps, in some cases riding the
same roads, but France was so much harder. On some days we struggled
to ride 80km, and it would turn out that in those 80km, we'd climbed
nearly 3000m. For the same reasons, however, the network of roads in
the French Alps makes for excellent choice in routes and roads, which
makes the area worth a repeated visit. I can certainly understand why
Jobst returns year after year to ride the same areas.
<p>
I didn't like Italy this time any more than I liked it in the <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/piawandlisa/trip2003.html">previous
trip</a>. As Werner said, "As long as you're in the mountains, the
Italians are OK, but once you're in the valleys..." It is very telling
the Mike had no trouble whatsoever on the high alpine passes in France
only to crash on a 100m hill in Italy with reckless, speeding Italian
drivers. I will endeavour to stay as much away from the Italian plains
from now on. Actually, I see no reason to visit Italy on a bike tour
except to visit the Dolomites and the Italian Alps. If what I saw was
typical Italian driving behavior, I can't imagine the rest of Italy as
being worth visiting, no matter how pretty it is. I was also surprised
to discover that Italy was more expensive than France.
<p>
As the cost estimates given in the trip report reflect: anybody who
tries to tell you that Europe is an expensive place to visit is
probably trying to prevent American tourists from driving the prices
up. If you're bicycle touring, Europe is just as cheap as any place in
America I've visited. The drivers are certainly more pleasant. There
is also no reason to spend $200-$400 a day on a tour organizer if you
are willing to carry your own lugguage: accomodations were plentiful
--- except for the one day on Grosse Scheideegg, we always found
accomodations where we wanted to stay, and we had plenty of
flexibility to come and go as we pleased. Whenever we couldn't find a
convenient restaurant for lunch, we always found a bakery or a grocery
store instead. Do try to eat at the local restaurants and stay at
hotels owned by families. They are good value, for one thing, and help
prevent the Americanization of Europe. Do bring plenty of Endurolytes
and nutrition bars, though, since bike shops are opened at
inconvenient hours if you're touring, and even when they are open they
don't seem to stock these staples of cycling fare.
