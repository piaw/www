<h2>Day 13: Chieri to  St. Christophe (139km,  1215m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up early and ate our anemic breakfast. Not waiting for
breakfast enabled us to pack, get our bikes, and get on the road by
8:00am. We asked for directions from the woman receptionist (well, she
was actually arranging the breakfast table --- we were that early),
and she pointed them out on the map for me.
<p>
Riding out, we found the traffic surprisingly heavy --- until I
realized that it was rush hour. As was usual with Italy, there were
sirens of ambulances rushing from one place to another as the
inevitable recklessness of Italian drivers took their toll. We turned
off the main road pretty quickly (at the sign for Baldissero) and
started to enjoy reduced traffic, along with a few hills. Riding along
the Italian countryside I found much beauty in the scenery
<a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1063.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1063.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a>, marred with an occasional curse as yet another Italian
driver buzzed me at too great a speed too close for comfort.
<p>
Finally, we reached the top of our local hills at Baldissero, and
started a long speedy descent. The road was narrow, steep, and had a
surprising amount of traffic but I felt completely in control. At one
point I squeezed into a 3 foot gap between a speeding oncoming truck
and the side of the road, negotiated a hairpin, and came out the other
side pleased with myself. I was much less pleased with myself when I
realized a couple of hairpins later that Mike, who was right behind
me, was no longer right behind me. I stopped, parked my bike off the
road way, and contemplated the situation. The traffic kept speeding
uphill, so I guessed that any possible accident had to be relatively
small, or there would be a massive traffic backup. Not even Italians
would be so callous as to run over a downed cyclist, would they? I
waited a little bit more, and just as I had concluded that indeed,
Italians would run over downed cyclists if it saved them 3 seconds,
Mike appeared. His bike seemed fine, but he was bleeding from the
elbow.
<p>
I clucked at the wound and gave him my waterbottle to clean it
up. There was a first aid kit but it was deep inside Mike's
saddlebag. We were near the next town, so I opted to ride down the
rest of the hill and sure enough just before the intersection with the
main road to Gassino there was a pharmacy. We walked in and got ourselves
an antiseptic spray (which I used liberally on Mike's elbow), and some
gauze, which we used to mop up the wound. "Did anybody even stop?"
"Yeah, the driver of the truck you dodged stopped, but I sent him on
since I didn't think anything was broken." That made me feel
better. "Was this your first crash on the road bike?" "Yep. My first
crash on the road bike. That's why I was so shaken up it took me
awhile to get on the bike and get back down. When I fell and got up, I
knew I couldn't get on the bike right away, so I checked the bike
thoroughly and caught my breath."
<p>
We kept going for a little bit more along the main road, but I spotted
a supermarket and stopped. We went in, bought bananas, saran wrap, and
Mike got out the first aid kit. I cleaned the wound again, wrapped
Saran wrap around it (though not without struggling with the packaging
at first --- Italian saran wrap is really really thin!), and then
wrapped a gauze bandage on the outside.
<p>
We got back on the road again, and rode on without further incident,
turning across the bridge into Chivasso, then turning off onto the
less busy streets towards Montanaro, Foglizzo, Montalenghe, and
Romano. Navigating through the city streets and getting us as far away
from the main roads as possible while still generally headed towards
Ivrea. Away from the big city of Torino, and away from rush hour,
traffic finally dwindled down to just a handful of cars per hour,
which is about as much traffic as I felt comfortable with in this
country.
<p>
Near Ivrea, we stopped to get on the main highway, and once again,
motorists behind us honked and yelled obscenities at us, demonstrating
their impatience. I have heard there are folks who spend their entire
vacations cycling in Italy. Maybe one of them will write me and
explain that it's just Piedmont Italian drivers that are bad. In
Ivrea, we stopped at a fast Pizza place and ate a pizza and ice
cream. There was a pharmacy across the street and we bought sunscreen,
and Mike went to a Bancomart to get more cash.
<p>
North of Ivrea we started heading towards Settimo V <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1069.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1069.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT></a>, the
descent into which I remembered well from my tour 2 years ago with
Lisa. Once past Settimo we would now be in familiar territory, and I
would no longer have need to consult a map. We stopped in Montesanto
to refill water bottles and take salt pills to prepare for the 10%
grade over the next section. Being on a single this time, the grade
wasn't as bad as I remembered but the 3 tunnels on the descent were
much worse.
<p>
As we pulled near Aosta (509m), I suggested that we stay at the first town
before Aosta, rather than Aosta proper, since I remember the traffic
in Aosta being rather bad and I wasn't excited about the city
itself. Mike was initially resistant, but as the road windened and
advertisements for McDonald's became more and more prominent he began
to turn around.
<p>
We stopped at a roadside hotel to ask the price --- the lady wanted
50Euros, but I had questions about how quiet the place would be. So we
kept riding on, and on a hunch I turned right up a hill at a sign that
said St. Christophe, and there were indeed 2 hotels about 30 meters
up. We stopped at the first one, where the manager made fun of me for
not knowing Italian, and showed me a lovely non-smoking suite for 50
Euros. We took it.
<p>
I could tell you that things went smoothly after that, but that would
be a fairy tale. This is Italy! Mike started with a shower, and I told
him to scrub himself thoroughly. He took a long time taking a shower,
so I assumed that he was being extra careful. When he came out, I
re-did his bandages and saran wrap, but he said, "The water pressure's
low."
<p>
Well, I know what to do about that! I went downstairs and complained
to the manager. He came up, along with a mechanic, and together they
looked at the state of the faucet and the shower. The mechanic said
something to Italian to the manager, and the manager looked at me, and
shook his head, "The town's water is dead. No water for now. It'll
come back in a few hours." So there I was in Italy, having ridden
140km, and there was no water for a shower. But at least the view was
nice!
<p>
I hung up the damp clothes to dry, and sat back and contemplated the
changing light outside. <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1072.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1072.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></a> Sure enough, at 6:30, the water
came back on, and I quickly took a cold shower, determined to get
clean before the fickle municipal authorities changed their
minds. Clothes washing followed, and with the wind now blowing I hoped
things would dry by the morning.
<p>
We walked around what little town there was looking for dinner. One
was a hotel with a menu that did not look at all appetizing. Another
was closed. That left our hotel, which had a menu that looked good. We
went into the restaurant, said hi to the staff, and sat down, but
nobody seemed to care that we were there. One of the staff started
setting tables that were unset, but we looked like the only customers
there, so I felt like I was in a kind of twilight zone.
<p>
Eventually the hotel manager came by, and told us there was no menu
today, and that we should be happy with spaghetti and a salad. That
sounded good to us, so we agreed to have whatever he was willing to
give us. The spaghetti was indeed very good, and we quickly mopped up
any leftover sauce with bread.
<p>
I asked Mike if the trip had been what he'd expected, and he said that
I had told him to expect 60-80 miles a day, and it had been right
on. He knew that carrying a load up mountains would be hard, but he
didn't expect it to be as hard as it had turned out to be. "I learnt a
lot on this trip," he said in such a way as to say that he would
contemplate doing his own trip in the future.
<p>
The "salad" turned out to be a meat dish, though what it was we didn't
know. It might have been veal. We didn't ask any questions just ate
it. We asked for dessert, and ordered tiramisu, which was also
good. Having had a satisfying dinner, we went up stairs to take
pictures from the hotel room, rest, and reallocate what we were
carrying. Mike was going to return from Martigny to Zurich to fly home
the next day, so if there was anything I wanted with me, I would have
to move it to my saddlebag.
<p>
I gave Mike the French Maps and French OCD guide while I took the
Swiss Maps and Swiss OCD guide. I took the shampoo bottle and the
spare tire. I wondered if I would have any use for the tire, but
convinced myself that it was one of those things that was nice to
have. Mike's tubes were unpatched, so I traded my patched tubes for
his new ones.
