<h2>Day 19: Rickenbach to  Rickenbach (124km,  3135m)</h2>
<p>
We woke up in the morning to overcast skies, which did not bother us
since we were planning to climb our 20% grade first. After a good
breakfast where the hostess asked us if she needed to bring us more
bread or hot chocolate (since everything on the table was disappearing
at an unprecedented rate to her, I'm sure), we got ready to go. Or
rather, I got ready to go, and Steve putzed around some. For someone
with so little stuff, I said, you sure managed to putz around a lot! I
used to think you had to have a lot of stuff before you could spend a
lot of time putzing around, but Steve had proven to me that putzing is
a personality issue, not a volume issue.
<p>
We rolled down the hill into Schwyz again, and once there, followed
the signs towards Muotathal. The initial part of the climb, very gentle,
was mostly along a wooded river. After Muotathal, where we stopped to
buy bananas, however, the road quickly narrowed and became a steep 20%
grade switch-backing amongst the woods. I was delighted. Traffic was
extremely low, and energetic climbing was what this morning called
for.
<p>
Despite the chill, the grade worked us so hard that I found myself
working hard enough to sweat. After a couple of kilometers we
discovered that we each had to climb at our own pace. Steve measured a
slope at 15% grade, which indicated that in some of the tougher
sections the slope might very well have reached 20% as the local
cyclist said.
<p>
At 1500m, a 20% grade cannot go on for too long, so after several
whirls around the hills the grade flattened out and I was rolling at
26-30kph, which cooled me down considerably. Cattle guards became more
prevalent, but it was no effort to roll over them quickly so I enjoyed
myself. Soon enough, I was at the top (1550m), which had amongst other things
meant immediately putting on leg warmers, arm warmers, and a jacket
before Steve showed up and we shot a few pictures. The downhill was
much more gentle than the up, and gave us great swooping descents down
amonst villages before we saw the Kolantarsee, a beautiful, peaceful
lake at 850m that I enjoyed. <a href="http://mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/images/img_1185.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.mikesamuel.com/alps2005/photos/thumbnails/img_1185.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT></a> We then descended down to the
town of Glarus, where an advertised 15 Franc lunch caught our
attention and we ate excellent country food.
<p>
After lunch, we dropped some more towards Schwanden where we started
climbing towards Linthal. This was when the weather started turning
ugly, as on the way to Linthal it started first sprinkling, then
drizzling, then finally raining. I made for the Linthal train station
hoping that there would be a train directly to Altdorf and I could
spare myself another freezing descent. There, however, I discovered
that the way over Klausen pass was not a train tunnel but a postal
bus. Well, I had no choice but to ride then. Steve was going to do the
pass no matter what, but he was better equipped for cold weather than
I was.
<p>
Above Linthal, the rain became steady, pouring down on me. The grade
was steep, so I had no trouble staying warm, but I nevertheless was
worried about how the top would be if it was raining down at the
bottom. Near the top of the steep section, a postal bus overtook me
and inexplicably waited at a bus stop. My biggest mistake of the day
was not sprinting after the bus and getting on board, because at that
point the rain had lightened up a bit. After the steep hairpins above
Linthal, there was a flat rolling section through Urnerboden, which
forced me to put on my new rain jacket to stay warm. At the next bus
stop I actually stopped to see when the next bus would come by --- the
answer: 5:00pm, which would require more than an hour wait, so I
pushed on.
<p>
Above the town of port the road once again started a series of
switchbacks that led to the summit, and the weather actually got worse
here. Rain came down like sheets, causing my eyes to tear up and the
temperature dropped. Fortunately what the latter did for me was to
enable me to work harder despite wearing a rain jacket so I pushed and
pushed from one switch back to another. I chewed through a couple of
Gu packs, and about 2 switchbacks from the top the rain finally
stopped. At the summit (1948m), I parked my bike and went into the
restaurant. I asked if they sold gloves, but the restaurant owner,
being the savvy cyclist-aware person she was handed me 2 plastic bags
instead. I went outside, put on every bit of clothing that I had
(fortunately my legwarmers had stayed warm and dry inside the
handlebar bag) and wrapped my fingers inside the plastic bag and
clenched my teeth for the descent.
<p>
The descent into Unterschau was gentle, and so beautiful that it shook
me out of my stupor to shoot a picture. The corners were gentle and I
was in a hurry to get somewhere warm, so I descended with a fury
normally reserved for dryer conditions. Avocet slick tires grip very
well on wet pavement, so I had confidence that my descent was
safe. After Unterschau, however, there was a short climb that I was
unprepared for. Getting impatient and well aware that the grocery
stores closed at 6:30, I tried to push on the pedals but found that
cold muscles do not respond and was forced to slowly climb the
hill. Once the descent started again, however, I moved at a rapid
clip, and made Altdorf (458m) by 5:30pm. There, I found a supermarket and
must have been a sight, walking in and buying pasta, pasta sauce, and
a banana shivering all the while. My lips moved like that of an
alcoholic at the checkout counter: "direction bahnof?" The girl at the
counter stared at me and gestured at the road. Seemed like I was
moving at the right direction.
<p>
The Altdorf bahnof is actually at Fluelen, on the other side of the
road with no apparent access for bicyclists. At Fluelen, I rode past
the train station and was forced to turn around and ask a couple of
pedestrains how to get to the train station. They told me that there
was a tunnel next to the church which I had passed, and I found it. At
the train station I bought a ticket back to Schwyz, not wanting to
deal with the tunnels or the rain. Once on the train, I called Steve
to let him know I had gotten groceries, how to get to the train
station, and that I'd see him back at the B&B.
<p>
The rain again resumed in Schwyz, but I managed to get to a pharmacy
to buy some soap for the shower and made the rest of the climb up to
the B&B with no incidents. A hot shower later and I felt human. I
looked at my altimeter and was surprised that we had done more
climbing on this day than any other day on the trip. I am still not
sure that the changing weather hadn't caused the altimeter to register
more climbing than the actual altitude gained, so if anyone out there
has accurate figures for the passes we climbed in the direction we did
it, I would be very happy to correct my numbers. I started dinner when
Steve called to say that he was at the train station, but of course I
should have realized that his ability to putz around knew no bounds
--- he actually stopped to clean his bike,  so by the time he got home
I was done with my dinner and almost ready to eat his as well.
<p>
That evening, I delegated the dishwashing to Steve and went to bed
early. The warmth of the blankets in bed made the cold long descent
from Klausen pass seem a bad dream.
