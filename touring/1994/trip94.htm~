<H1>The Oregon Coast </H1>

<H1>An Auspicious Beginning </H1>

<P>
July 10th, 1994
<P>
I got up around 7am, packed my panniers and cleared up my room.
I brought everything downstairs, and dragged my touring bike outside.
Gathering my bungee cords together, I pondered my problem: the
springs on my Cannondale Overland panniers had stretched inelastically
last year early in my trip, and I had relied on the weight of
my tent, sleeping pad, and sleeping bag on the panniers to keep
them on the bike. I was not willing to put up with this again,
I reflected...
<P>
I eventually simulated a spring system on the overland by using
the second hook on the overland panniers. Then I laid on the tent,
sleeping bag, and pad, whose arrangement I had perfected last
year. Then came on the front panniers. The bike looked ready to
go. I said goodbye to Christina, my landlady, rolled my bike out
onto the road, got on it, and rode out. Foolishly, I had not practiced
riding my bike around in a fully loaded configuration, but this
didn't bother me. Last year, when I started out, my bike felt
heavy, handled sluggishly, and I felt like sending all my stuff
home. This time, it felt as though my panniers had never left
my bike all this time --- the ride was smooth, the balance damn
near perfect --- in fact, I thought that my bike rode better with
all the weight on it! Probably a combination of reduced weight
and another year of bike handling lessons.
<P>
It was bright and sunny outside, with barely a cloud in the sky.
Rolling towards downtown and the waterfront, everything felt good.
I meshed in with the traffic perfectly, everyone treated me like
they saw fully loaded bicycles every day of the year, and many
drivers waved at me or at least smiled at me. At the ferry, I
got directed to the proper ferry terminal after a bit of meandering,
and stood around breathing the fresh salt air. I had my sunscreen
on, so it didn't bother me to be standing in the sun, and things
were so cool that I had a windbreaker on anyway. Boarding the
ferry to Bremerton made me feel like I embarking on a long trip
--- symbolic, perhaps, crossing water being the first thing I
do.
<P>
I quickly rode onto the front of the ferry and tied my bike to
the sides with extra bungee cords (don't leave home without those!),
and went upstairs with a book. I sat down and read for about half
an hour before the ferry dived into the fog, which had me by surprise.
I looked around and kept my fingers crossed and sure enough, we
emerged into the sun not less than 15 minutes later, within sight
of land. The ferry did a bit of maneuvering in the channel, and
we eventually arrived at Bremerton. I'd been in Bremerton before,
but in a car on the way to a mountain bike experience, and I once
again experienced the old cliche that everything looks different
on a bicycle. I rode up to the information office and asked around
for directions to Twanoh state park (I was carrying a map, but
I wanted to know the distance to various parks), but got nothing
for my efforts except for directions to the nearest public restrooms.
<P>
I rolled down back to the ferry terminal for that, and was accosted
by a bunch of tourists wielding video-cameras. I put on my deep
voice and obliged them with an interview.

&quot;Where are you from?&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Singapore.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Where did you start?&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Seattle.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;San Francisco.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;How far is that?&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Oh, about a thousand miles.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
They wished me well, and I went on to lose some weight, with that
auspicious beginning behind me.
<P>
I rode my way out of city, and headed onto Highway 3, an ugly,
busy throughfare with little to recommend it except wide shoulders.
Rolling hills and timber-harvested land greeted me, and I made
decent time --- I discovered that standing on my bike caused it
to sway horribly and gave me an &quot;I'm going to die&quot; kind
of feeling. Oh, well, I'll just sit and spin --- that's probably
better for my knees anyway.
<P>
I soon got to 106, however, and what a difference! Shade from
trees, and the road's in an elevated position looking over the
hood canal. You can look out, and on the other side, see hills,
buildings, and beyond those hills the purple mountains that form
the snow-capped Olympics. The road is perfect --- smooth with
rolling curves, and next to no traffic. A true gem.
<P>
I rolled for about 9 miles before getting to Twanoh state park,
where I stopped and asked the ranger where Scahefer state park
was. I felt really good, and if it had been pretty close, I would
have gone for it. But he told me it was about 45 miles or so,
and I decided to stay at Twanoh for the night.
<P>
I unpacked my tent, set up everything, and proceeded to take a
shower and a walk.
<P>
Twanoh state park is a pretty park, with lots of evergreen trees,
and a beach nearby. Everyone there was camping for more than a
night --- it was so pretty. I spent time talking to various people.
The hike to the top gave me a nice and different workout from
the ride there.
<P>
I had done 29 miles today. A wimpy ride by anybody's standards,
but I'm taking care of my knees. I applied a patch of Chinese
medicine, made dinner (freeze dried food --- what a luxury!),
and curiously looked at what others were doing.
<P>
I then sat near the beach and watched the sun set down behind
the Olympics, turning the sky pink, gold, and purple...
<P>
I finished the book.
<H1>Almost to The Coast </H1>

<P>
July 11th, 1994, Saturday
<P>
I got up to an overcast sky, and set about riding. 106 was as
pretty as ever, and it wasn't 10 minutes later when unexpected
sunshine stopped me and had me doff my jacket, put on sunscreen,
and sunglasses.
<P>
I rode into the first little town I ran into, and walked into
the grocery store. The shopkeeper immediately jumped in and helped
with the selection of pasta, pasta sauce, and tried to persuade
me to buy some french bread. Too bad I'd already had breakfast!
<P>
106 ended way too quickly, and I turned down purdy cutoff drive,
which took me through rain-forest like surroundings, a stream,
and a bracingly fresh smell in the air. I love this. Even now,
I can smell the forest, sitting in front of a computer.
<P>
Purdy cutoff went on for a few miles and then turned onto 101.
At last! Last year, I'd abandoned the ride about 10 miles north
of where purdy cutoff intersects with 101, and I was finally leaving
that behind. I went along 101 for quite aways, following, once
again, Kirkendall and Spring's book. I then stopped at some little
residential area trying to figure out some directions --- I wanted
to get to Schaefer State Park, which was not anywhere in the book.
A helpful local came along, and gave me directions that saved
maybe 5 miles off the obvious route. I immediately turned around
for about a quarter mile and turned left on Dayton Airport road,
which took me past a building that looked suspiciously like a
prison, causing me to turn on the speed a little. Dayton Airport
road eventually joins up with Shelton-Matlock road, which takes
you past Nahwatzel Lake, which looks like a good place to be near
on the map, but turns out to be surrounded entirely by private
property, which means no Lake access whatsoever --- a total loss.
<P>
I pushed on, and downed a hill, and climbed back up. This area
would be prettier, if not for the clear cutting --- I saw lots
of signs involving Tree farms and such. I could see how this is
a great idea, but still, it wasn't pretty. I eventually got to
Matlock, where I mailed the book home, and there, I was told that
Schaefer was about 12 miles away. It turned out to be about 10
miles down a straight road. It was quite windy, so I rode it like
a time trial, got into the park, and proceeded to make lunch,
and then make camp. The hiker-biker site in Schaefer is a sunken
area that's quite pretty.
<P>
I walked around, exploring some trails (I'm sorry, but I'm getting
bored with rainforests... :-), and the river. I met a couple of
people, some of which gave me contradictory directions, and made
comments on whether I really intended to go that far. I smiled
and went on to cook dinner.
<H1>The Pacific Coast at Last! </H1>

<P>
June 12th, 1994
<P>
The best thing about hiker biker sites is that they're so quiet
--- especially when I'm alone in them. I slept soundly and well,
and woke up to no rain but an overcast sky. I quickly made breakfast
using my second MSR fuel bottle (I'd ran out the day before on
my first bottle), and packed and left.
<P>
I was barely out of the park before the rain started. I quickly
put on my rain cape and kept riding on Middle Satsop road towards
Brady. Ahead of me, the defunct nuclear power station rose up.
I rode past farmland, and the drizzle slowed. &quot;Come on, you
can do better than that!&quot; I shook my fist at the sky. I would
regret that later.
<P>
The sky obligingly closed up, and I got rid of the rain gear and
cycled along the empty road listening to the sound of birds singing,
passing cows and horses. I eventually got onto Brady, and linked
up once again with Kirkendall and Spring's route. I was forced
to get onto 12 at Montesano, and rolled merrily along on the freeway,
trying to turn a deaf ear to the roar of engines and high speed
vehicles.
<P>
Lots of rolling hills but still air kept me going quite fast towards
Aberdeen, when that dreaded &quot;right lane closed, construction
ahead&quot; sign loomed up. I quickly decided to take my bike
through the construction instead of along the narrowed roadway.
This was my first off-pavement experience with my fully loaded
touring bike, and things went surprisingly well. I slowed down
a bit, and had to take a bit of care, but maneuvering around the
construction crew was surprisingly easy, and my fenders didn't
get quite stuck in mud.
<P>
I was forced to get back on to the road for the final 200 yards
of construction, but fortunately that was downhill, and I quickly
zipped into Aberdeen. A metal grate bridge loomed up, however,
and forced me to dismount and walk along the sidewalk to negotiate
that section --- no Eric House heroics for me. :-)
<P>
I caught the eye of a pretty woman driving a nice car, and asked
for directions to Westport. She kindly told me, and then asked
me to get in in front of her when the light changed, and she'd
block traffic for me as I climbed the on-ramp to 105. I rode onto
105 with ease thanks to that support, and headed for Westport.
The first few miles were fine, but a headwind quickly built up,
and rain came down with it in big heavy droplets. I put on my
raincape again, and peddled along in low gear on the flats at
about 6 mph.
<P>
Agony. The miles felt eternal --- this is the kind of weather
that caused my knee injury a few months ago, and I was losing
patience, an easy way to get injured. Bridges took forever, hills
took forever, and I had to pedal down hills to keep moving.
<P>
I eventually got to Twin Harbors state park, and found that among
other things, there was no shelter for cooking. I'd reached the
Pacific Coast on my own power, but felt no sense of triumph, just
a resigned weariness. I found out about the bus schedule and set
up my tent and locked up my bike. I took the bus into town, looking
for a good restaurant. The bus is a nice flexible-schedule one,
and the bus driver dropped me in front of Sourdoug Lil's, a restaurant
that he promised was excellent. I had a huge dinner to the amused
stares of the waitresses, and got out to walk around. The town
looked dreary to my eyes, and the wind only got stronger. I walked
into a second hand book store in order to buy a couple of books
to tide what was sure to be a horribly wet night over.
<P>
When I stepped out of the store there was easily a full gale going
on. After talking to a couple of sailors who'd docked because
of the gale warning, I resolved that if I could get a motel owner
to drive all my stuff back from the state park, I would happily
pay the premium for a room. I walked into the first motel I saw
when I stepped out of Sourdoug Lil's --- the Westport Candy Shoppe
Motel. Roxie Stiles was in there, and she told me that her husband
would be returning shortly, and would be willing to give my stuff
a lift from Twin Harbors state park. I quickly agreed, and when
Don got in, got into the van, got to my tent, packed up everything,
and got back to the motel, where Don and Roxie gave me a discount
on the rates. (I won't tell you what their rates are, but they're
incredibly reasonable, especially for a single person)
<P>
I gratefully got into my motel room, took a nice hot shower, and
washed everything that needed washing and hung everything out
to dry. I was delighed to find a stove and pots and pans among
the other features of the rooms, and took advantage of that. Roxie
gave me some hot chocolate, and soon I was happily in bed, dreaming
of a good start the next day.
<H1>Can you believe I spent a day watching MTV? </H1>

<P>
June 13th, 1994
<P>
I got up at 3am, turned on the TV (cable included), and switched
to the marine forecast channel. &quot;20 foot waves, 25mph south
wind on the coast... Small craft advisory... &quot; I groaned
and went back to sleep.
<P>
A howling wind outside my window at 9am woke me up for real. I
stepped outside to mail some postcards and promptly decided I
wasn't going anywhere today. I had breakfast, went out onto the
docks during a lull, and ran into another bunch of sailors. They
invited me onto their boat, and we started discussing the weather
and the wind.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Did you sail in? Where's your boat?&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;No, no. I'm just a cyclist.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Amazing how the two different sports are united (and stuck in
dock, so to speak) during poor weather like this.
<P>
We talked about technology, society, and sailing. We had a great
time, with wind and waves knocking the boat around on the dock
while we chatted. Eventually, I went back to the motel room and
made dinner and ate it, all the while finishing the rest of my
second book.
<H1>Wimped out and hitched a ride </H1>

<P>
June 14th, 1994
<P>
A 15mph south wind blew into my face as I stepped out. But I was
running out of time, and was determined to go on. Just then, Roxie
poked her head in, and asked if I wanted a ride as far as Astoria.
I wanted to cross the Oregon border under my own power, but I
was more than happy to accept a ride to Fort Columbia youth hostel.
<P>
They asked me if they could take me out to lunch, too! On the
drive down, I discovered that Don used to be the regional director
of the Oregon Coast state parks. He still gave classes on park
management, on occassion, and spoke with the voice of authority.
<P>
&quot;Those alders behind the campsites in Twin Harbors are a
really bad idea,&quot; he said, &quot;Alders last maybe 10 years
and then collapse all of a sudden and break up.&quot;
<P>
He was clearly unhappy at how much ignorance there was in public
lands management today.
<P>
&quot;The new generation is into conservation, and tries to discourage
use, but I think that's short sighted, as the tax payers won't
support parks if they don't use them!&quot;
<P>
He taught me how to distinguish between Alders, Spruce, Douglas
Fir, and some other trees that I promptly forgot. Roxie taught
me about Hemlock and Foxgloves, and I felt really fortunate to
have experienced tour guides on that drive down the rugged Washington
coast.
<P>
How can I express how nice people have been to me? How can I tell
you about people I've met, favors that have been given me just
out of kindness --- all I can do is just pass it on.
<P>
If you're ever worried about how dangerous a bicycle tour could
be for a single traveller, I can allay all your fears now ---
it feels so much safer than walking alone in a city that I'd happily
tour a year alone than live alone in New York City for a year.
<P>
We had lunch at Long Beach, and then it was on to Fort Columbia.
There were lots of sights and pretty places, but the weather was
ugly, and a motor vehicle's not the best way to see the country,
however convenient and unexposed to the weather it is, so I won't
describe it.
<P>
The hostel was nice but cold! I explored the area for a bit, and
eventually sat down next to the heater in the living room with
a cat on my lap to listen to music and work on the next book I
was reading. Other than the management, I was alone in that hostel
that night.
<H1>With Noxzema in my Shorts... </H1>

<P>
June 15th, 1994
<P>
I left the hostel at 9, and proceeded to ride across the bridge
to Astoria. There was a wind in my face, making the Bridge crossing
slow and scary, but it wasn't a strong wind. The overcast eliminated
any need for sunscreen. I raised my hand in victory as I crossed
into Oregon, as undeserved as that might be.
<P>
I rode the 10 miles or so to the Fort Clatsop memorial, where
I watched a slide show, a film, and a live demonstration of musket
loading. I explored the replica of the fort, and heard statistics
about the Lewis and Clark expedition like: &quot;Of the 106 days
they spent on the Oregon Coast, it did not rain on 12 days. Of
those 12 days, only 6 were sunny. In other words, they were wet
and miserable most of the time.&quot; Real heartening for a bicycle
tourist just heading out of a thunderstorm.
<P>
But it was sunny at noon, when I left Fort Clatsop after putting
on sunscreen. I rode south on a fairly windless condition, and
climbed a few hills and saw the coast in its glory for the first
time heading down towards Cannon Beach. (It is here that I really
must say that downhill speed is the great downfall of bicycle
touring --- once you get going really fast, there's no way you're
going to slow down to look at scenery or take photographs ---
at least, I don't know any bicycle tourists who do... Fortunately,
I've gotten into the habit of enjoying the scenery uphill...)
<P>
I swept into Cannon Beach down a fast hill, and stopped at Mike's
Bike shop to borrow a floor pump to top up my tires. Not that
it was stricly necessary, but I felt that prevention was better
than cure. I searched a bit for a place that sold white gas in
less than gallon amounts, but couldn't find one --- the salesperson
at the place I was in went out of his way to ask his customers
if any of them could spare white gas --- another example of the
generosity of many people towards cyclists.
<P>
I climbed out of Cannon Beach towards Oswald West State park,
which was highly praised enough by Don that I'd decided to spend
the night there and travel further the next day and forgo a hot
shower. I stopped at the first scenic view point, got a photograph
taken, had a bunch of people ask me questions, and there, someone
volunteered to give me some of his white gas.
<P>
I rode on down towards Short Sands campground. After a wrong turn
and some misexplorations of the state park, I found the campsite,
and spent an hour getting setup, and helping someone move camping
equipment from their car to the site. The site was indeed beautiful,
though the crows and racoons were pretty aggressive about getting
food from you (I kept everything locked up when I could), and
the site was expensive ($9). I took a cold shower by dumping pots
of cold water over my body and went down the beach.
<P>
The campsite was filled with younger people. I chatted with them,
and discovered that everyone else was going to the Grateful Dead
concert in Eugene in a couple of days, and most had come from
the Grateful Dead concert in Seattle. I was probably one of 5
people not going to the concert camping out on the Oregon coast.
There wasn't much of a sunset, as it was pretty cloudy, and when
I talked to one of the guys and found that he was sleeping outside
tonight, I told him that he was welcome to sleep in my tent that
night.
<P>
3 hours later, it started drizzling as I was chatting to another
group of campers, and I went back to my tent and packed all my
panniers into garbage bags, clearing out room for Mark, who had
decided that he would come out of the rain after all. (Dead fans
are pretty special people, I guess... :-)
<H1>Who put that ^#$@* mountain on my road? </H1>

<P>
June 16th, 1994
<P>
I had a good sleep, as I was pretty tired, and next morning left
late. I climbed up towards Nehalem, took a couple of pictures,
and headed down the hill. There I encountered the first bicycle
tourists I'd seen on this trip. It was a couple of women on heavy
bikes riding wrong way up the hill towards Portland. I chatted
to them, and they told me to avoid Cape Lookout because of &quot;bad
roads, lousy traffic, and steepness.&quot; I might have listened
to them if I hadn't caught them riding wrong way, and it would
have been my big loss.
<P>
There was a sudden downpour that came on me when I got to Tillamook,
and I pulled into a gas station to put on my rain gear. Someone
came up to me, and said, &quot;It's raining.&quot; Like I was
supposed to stop for that! Besides, it didn't look like it would
last, and I pushed into Tillamook. The Fort Columbia hostel had
an ad for a hospice in Tillamook that supposedly had a hot tub.
A hot tub felt like a good thing to me, so I sailed down 1st St
looking for it. A truck drove up with a fellow in it who told
me, &quot;One block to the left&quot; before I even opened my
mouth. I spent a few minutes looking for a non-existent hostel
(it reputedly had a hot-tub), before realizing that he meant the
3 capes scenic route and deciding that the weather was nice enough
for me to push onto Cape Lookout.
<P>
A couple of hours later, I was cursing my way up Cape Meares in
my granny gear. First, there was a headwind going towards the
climb, and secondly, it wasn't particularly pretty, since there
were too many trees blocking the view. It was also incredibly
hot, and I almost wished for my rain back. The descent was nice,
but my legs were pretty dead by then, and I didn't enjoy the headwind
into the park at all.
<P>
I rode into the park, found the hiker biker site, and there found
a German couple already camped out. They were going North, and
their bikes were set up with Aerobars. I took a shower, and talked
to them. Funny how it is that everyone asks you about Michael
Fay when they find out that you grew up in Singapore. Look ---
just because I grew up there doesn't mean I'm a big fan of the
government there. After all, I left that country for the USA,
and I would not return to Singapore for the world. The Michael
Fay case is probably a much better display of President Clinton's
(lack of) grasp of relations with a Chinese government than anything
else.
<P>
The beach at Cape Lookout is gorgeous, and firm enough to walk
on with no problems. I strolled along the beach, and came back
to find yet another cycle tourist had come in. This time, it was
a Swiss guy named Martin, who'd come in from Garibaldi that day.
When I found that he was going South, I asked if he wanted to
ride with me for a while tommorrow, and he agreed.
<P>
We had much the same equipment, and exchanged questions about
our tents and such. I showed him a thing or two, and he showed
me a thing or two.
<H1>Skies of grey are not today... </H1>

<P>
June 17th, 1994
<P>
Woke up to the sound of crows squawking. What a racket! Woke up
Martin, made breakfast, and broke camp. Put on a damp jersey.
Yeow! It stinks, it's cold, and I resolve never to do that again!
<P>
Martin and I left early, and proceeded to climb towards Cape Kiwanis.
Martin was having shifting problems, so on top of the hill, we
stopped and I maxed out the tension on his rear deraileur adjustment,
and that helped a bit, but decided that a bike shop would have
better luck. Martin had rapidFire on his Cannondale, so he didn't
even have a friction option to switch to while his bike was screwed
up. He made even more noise shifting than I did.
<P>
We came down the hill, and plunged right alongside some sand dunes,
where we stopped and took moving bike pictures of each other.
You know how you always see those in touring books and such? It
takes an amazing amount of set up to take one of these, and it's
not something easily done spontaneously. I'm just impressed that
we can get decent pictures doing this balancing act, saying cheese
and getting in the scenery at all.
<P>
We rode together towards Cape Kiwanis and drafted off each other,
going at a pretty good clip in spite of the headwind. We took
photographs near Cape Kiwanis, and proceeded up the sideroute
into the experimental forest. I found out that though Martin's
a much better climber than I was (probably because of all that
loaded touring he's done in the Swiss Alps), he was much slower
than I downhill, because of the aerodynamics of his bike. The
forest was really nice and shady, giving us gentle descents, and
thrilling hairpin descents. Then we headed towards Lincoln city,
and hit a bike shop about 5 miles away from Devil's Lake State
Park. We stopped there to get Martin's bike fixed.
<P>
We discovered several things: first of all, there was not a drop
of lubricant anywhere on the external parts of the bike. Second,
there was nothing to indicate that any adjustment had been made
in anticipation of stretching. Unfortunately, the Vancouver bike
shop that Martin bought his bike from probably ripped him off
in any number of ways. The bike shop owner cursed at them while
putting the bike through its paces and lubricating it. &quot;Yeah,
it's those B.C. and Seattle bike shops --- they can smell an European
tourist from a mile away...&quot;
<P>
I had a sudden insane craving for Chinese food and asked the bike
shop owner about Chinese food in the area. I was tired, and had
already decided on staying at Devil's Lake State Park. Martin
wanted to push on, so we stopped at a shopping mall, where I bought
postcards and a book, and he bought groceries, then we broke up.
<P>
I got my Chinese food after a shower and making camp. Not ideal,
but still, it was undeniably Chinese food and filled my stomach.
<P>
It was a really good day, with all the climbing in the shade,
and all the warm exposure when descending. I spent a half hour
talking to a boy who was fishing at the lake. I then retired to
my tent to do some reading, though not before calling the Newport
hostel to make a reservation, and calling my mom, who was leaving
on the 27th, and so wanted me back in Saratoga by then. I scaled
down my ambitions at that point, and decided to do just the Oregon
Coast.
<P>
I didn't sleep all that well, having been used to quiet campsites
the last couple of days, and having to get used to a hiker biker
site too close to a road. But still, tired cyclists don't generally
have trouble sleeping.
<H1>Raindrops keep falling on my head... </H1>

<P>
June 18th, 1994
<P>
I woke up to the sound of crows squawking and drizzle-drops on
my tent. I stayed in until the rain stopped, and then proceeded
to ride to the Newport Hostel.
<P>
It was only a 26 mile ride, but what a ride. First, a stop at
a wildlife observation area near Bay Cove allowed me to spot no
less than 3 whales --- a resident pod. The area was beautiful,
and the sun was up, bringing a brightness and freshness to everything.
<P>
A further ride brought me to the North end of the Otter Crest
Loop. I saw the &quot;closed to cars&quot; sign, and immediately
decided that I had to take it. Turns out that the Bridge was closed
for mainteneance, but kindly enough, the barricades were arranged
such that a loaded bicycle would have no problem negotiating it.
<P>
It didn't take long for the climb to get to a beautiful spot,
where I took a photograph of my stuffed animal. Resuming the ride
brought me through beautifully cool and shaded spots with nothing
but birdsongs and cricket noises. Another steep climb took me
to Cape Foulweather, and then it was a fast steep descent that
brought be back to 101.
<P>
Barely a few miles later, I was in Newport, which looked pretty
deserted to me. It was about 12:00 when I arrived, and so I went
down to the Bay Front for lunch, cotton candy, groceries and some
look-see. I ran into some other people I'd met while whale-watching,
and we greeted each other again.
<P>
Back at the Hostel, I dried out my tent, my cycling clothes, and
threw all my other clothes into the laundry machine and dryer,
wearing nothing but a towel in the mean time. I did some reading
while doing all that, and got everything dry (what a nice feeling!).
<P>
A lovely day!
<H1>Sidetrips, sidetrips, sidetrips... </H1>

<P>
June 19th, 1994
<P>
I woke up feeling lousy, made breakfast, and tried to sleep again.
By 9:00am, however, I felt ready for the road again, and thus
packed everything and left. I rode the scenic route out of Newport,
and promptly ran into the Sea Gulch, a place with beautifully
carved chainsaw statues that, while quite remarkable, left me
feeling like I'd gotten less than my $4 worth.
<P>
I rode on, stopping at Smelt Sands State Beach, where the sand
was black --- nobody was Smelt fishing, however. Entering the
park, however, I ran over a bump on the gravel road that bounced
the sleeping bag and mattress off my rear rack. I resolved to
pack my rolls more carefully, and turned the packing into a ritual.
<P>
Tailwinds brought me into the Cape Perpetua area. How could I
describe how pretty everything looked? Words cannot tell you of
the ragged steep coasts falling off to both sides of the viewpoint,
the sea stacks, the curving road. I hiked the 1.5 mile hike to
the top of the viewpoint, getting my calves scraped up in the
mean time, and caught my breath at the top, looking at the gorgeous
scenery, and hitched a ride back down.
<P>
Tailwinds pushed me along at 25 miles per hour. It was incredible
--- I barely had to work. I climbed up and through Cape Arch,
which, according to my map, was half way down the Oregon coast,
and the last tunnel I'd have to deal with. I stopped at the Sea
Lion caves, but the place looked way to commercial and I was tired,
so I kept going.
<P>
Past the Sea Lion caves, the coast highway archs down, and you
get a beautiful 30 mile view of the Oregon dunes. This was gorgeous,
but with a 37mph descent, I didn't want to stop, even for beautiful
pictures that this would have brought me. Lunch at &quot;The Blue
Hen&quot; at Florence. Florence was a non-descript, suburby kind
of town that wasn't particularly interesting.
<P>
I rode on to Jessie Honeyman State Park, where the hiker biker
site has been moved to be much closer to the rest rooms. (So those
of you who have Kirkendall &amp; Spring can update that!) I arrived
at the site to see 3 other cyclists already there. They kindly
took care of my stuff while I took a shower and came back. Robert
and Carleen were from Portland, and were returning to there from
Coos Bay. Philip, who was travelling with a big plastic sheet,
a bunch of blankets, and a ton of cigarettes was from Sacramento,
and was headed down to Coos Bay.
<P>
As we were chatting, another couple rode in. They turned out to
be British, and were on the 12th month of an 18 month round the
world tour. &quot;We saved for a couple of years, saved everything,
and then left!&quot; she said. I fielded the usual Michael Fay
questions, and took good note of their setup.
<P>
Travelling as a pair certainly made things easy for them --- they
had a pannier full of books, for instance. They also had an European
style-tent, which sets up the rainfly first, and has the advantage
that you can take down the interior first in a rain. They were
also hyper-efficient. For instance, everything was packed in their
panniers at nightfall, which stayed on their bikes with raincovers
on. In the morning, after breakfast, everything gets taken down
and mounted on the bikes, and then they're gone in less time than
it takes me to eat my breakfast, drink my orange juice, and finish
off my morning ablutions (sp?). It always takes me an embarrasingly
long time, I feel, to get set up and get going again.
<H1>Boredom strikes when you least expect it... </H1>

<P>
June 20th, 1994
<P>
I got up in the morning to grey skies and no tail wind. Everyone
left before I did, and I felt something scratchy in my throat,
in spite of all the orange juice that I had imbibed. But I didn't
want to stay at Honeyman, so I packed up and sped on to the Oregon
Dunes lookout, where I spent a good half hour walking around and
getting photographs.
<P>
Getting back on the bike again, I faced utter boredom in the next
30 miles or so to Coos Bay. Highway 101 turns off the coast, and
what I was left with was playing dodge with logging trucks and
an individual Time Trial that went on and on and on. I never felt
the desire for aerobars more.
<P>
Even North Bend and Coos Bay were boring as I rode through them.
My knees started bothering me (and I'm sure part of it was psychological),
and I rode on towards the Sunset Bay State Park. I resolved that
I would get a regular tent site rather than climb 2 more miles
to Cape Arago, but it turns out that they've moved the hiker biker
site to Sunset Bay Camping Area. (Another welcome change from
Kirkendall and Spring)
<P>
I was once again the lone cyclist at the camp site, and I was
too tired for small talk, so I set up everything, had dinner,
and slept.
<H1>Galleries, a good restaurant, and no sun. </H1>

<P>
June 21st, 1994
<P>
There's nothing more pleasant than waking up to the sound of birds
singing. Unfortunately, that's usually punctuated by squawking
crows as they try to steal your food.
<P>
The time had come, I decided, for another half day --- everything
was wet, and a ride to Bandon would be short and merciful.
<P>
The ride to Bandon was steep, however, and I was slow. The day
was too cold and misty for me to be able to see much, though I
could see how the area would be gorgeous if only the sun was up.
I did manage to stop at the Estruary information center, where
I looked at the exhibits and watched a video --- I was quite impressed,
and wished I had more time to spend hiking or canoeing around
the area.
<P>
The rest of the ride into Bandon was non-descript, and I found
the Hostel with little trouble. There, I had lunch and chatted
with various people. There were 2 women cyclists who were using
the Hostel to implement a rest day, and after I'd taken my shower,
2 more cyclists showed up. Liz and Claire were doing light touring,
just carrying their clothes and staying at motels and hostels.
Larry and Jeremy were camping tourists who'd just started from
Florence a couple of days ago.
<P>
Jeremy was the funniest cycle tourist I'd ever met, since he hates
cycling (or at least claims to). &quot;I hate it.&quot; &quot;Then
why are you doing this?&quot; &quot;Because it's a good way to
travel. It's cheap, you get to be intimate with the country, and
you can stop whenever you want, and you see so much more!&quot;
<P>
Jeremy had already done a cross country trip last year, so he
was pretty experienced.
<P>
Liz and Claire were taking the day off, and were doing about 30
miles a day. You really meet all types of people on the coast.
They kindly provided me with a list of cheap places to stay for
the benefit of netters.
<P>
I walked around, bought a book, and sent a book home, and wandered
into various galleries. I found that I really really liked Richard
Hazelton's washes a lot, but couldn't afford them, and he doesn't
do prints or postcards. If any of you ever pass by Cannon Beach,
look for his main gallery there. Unfortunately, I'd already zoomed
past Cannon Beach, and wasn't about to turn around and head North.
Next time, I resolved. I also saw a kind of art involving Beeswax
(see appendix) that would make BOBs happy.
<P>
I had dinner at Harp's easily made it the best restaurant I've
wandered in at the coast yet. The halibut was done just right,
tender, and when you stick a fork into it, you can see all the
juice oozing right out of the meat, and the aroma reaches out
and grabs you. I ate and ate and ate and startled the waiters.
I then asked for a few rolls of their bread for the road the next
day. (Yep, excellent bread too!)
<P>
I asked Jeremy and Larry if they wanted to head over to Humbug
the next day together, and they said yes.
<H1>Why wear cycling shorts with underwear? </H1>

<P>
June 22nd, 1994
<P>
It started out cloudy, and the weather didn't seem so good, except
that there was a North wind, which made me happy. We left at around
9, and it was then that I noticed that Jeremy and Larry were wearing
underwear under their shorts. I asked them why, and they said,
&quot;You mean, you're not supposed to wear underwear under this?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, the chamois for chafing, you know...&quot; &quot;And
I thought it was just for padding.&quot;
<P>
No wonder they could get away with a pair of shorts each for a
3 week tour! And there I was thinking that they must have had
iron constitutions, to be able to put on a wet pair of shorts
every morning.
<P>
It's really amazing how much less weight each person has to carry
when you're travelling as a team --- everything both of them had
fit into their panniers --- none of that huge tent, sleeping bag
and pad roll that I had was in evidence among them.
<P>
We sailed by seastacks that morning, taking photographs, and then
it was a long rolling ride to Humbug Mountain. If anything indicated
how comfortable I was on a bike by now, this was it. I'd roll
down a hill on my drops, switch back to the tops after slowing
on the way up the next one, shifting as I did so, and before cresting
the hill, would have reached back to my jersey pockets, picked
up a roll of bread, and taken a big bite out of it and put it
back, and gotten some water into my body while I was at it. I
felt like I'd been doing this for ages!
<P>
The countryside around us was beautiful. Farmland punctuated by
green, undeveloped land, and the cloudy sky occasionally let in
a ray of sunlight, spotlighting places on the road, or a patch
of trees, or a few blades of grass. Wildflowers lined the side
of the road, and the tail wind picked us up and pushed us along.
Life is sweet.
<P>
Jeremy collects pressed flowers, so twice we stopped and took
photos while he collected some flora. I taught Larry and Jeremy
how to draft off each other, and they got pretty good at it.
<P>
And then we were at Port Orford. We bought supplies for dinner
(since we were camping together, we decided we'd share the food
and stuff), and had lunch outside a pastry shop.
<P>
We then headed on South, stopping at the South end of Port Orford
for some gorgeous views of the upcoming Humbug Mountain. Seastacks
aplenty and rolling coastlines. I should be tired of it by now,
but I'm not.
<P>
&quot;By this time last year, I was too busy trying to push 100
miles a day or so to stop and enjoy the scenery,&quot; said Jeremy.
&quot;I'm glad I'm here again to pick up what I missed last time...&quot;
<P>
We proceeded out of Port Orford and started up Humbug Mountain.
The mountain reared up to the left of us, a big brooding mass.
But to the right was a sheer dropoff, and further out were scattered
rocks like marbles left in a sandbox. The traffic wasn't bad at
all, and though there was some construction going on on the road,
the crew happily waved us past every time.
<P>
The long fast descent into Humbug Mountain Campground led us right
into the camping area and hiker biker camp. Another update to
Kirkendall and Spring: The hiker biker site is no longer in the
Forest, and is no longer full of bugs. Stay there with pleasure.
<P>
I set up camp, impressing a couple of spectators with the NHP
pitching system while Jeremy and Larry played chess. I then took
a shower. (That's the difference between them and I --- I look
for a shower the moment I'm done with my tent, and they worry
about food) We then made dinner. Jeremy used unleaded gas in his
Whisperlite International (which, by the way, probably viods the
warranty). &quot;It's cheap, you don't have to run around looking
for people to give you white gas or find it in quart bottles,
but you have to clean it more often.&quot; Jeremy cleaned his
once a week. I have yet to clean my Whisperlite. But at 22 cents
per bottle, I might just try it. (No conversion necessary, and
the new Whisperlite International 600 burns unleaded gas)
<P>
We made a huge dinner and ate most of it when another cyclist
showed up. We gave the rest of the dinner to Jain, who was a German
tourist riding up the coast. When Larry asked Jain what he thought
of America, he pointed to a loaf of bread.
<P>
&quot;You see this thing? It's incredible. You can crush it, you
can bash it, you can roll it up, you can bounce it, you can play
basketball with it... But are human beings actually supposed to
eat this stuff?&quot;
<P>
We laughed. It's so true, though.
<P>
&quot;Also, everything's `biggest', `tallest', `shortest', `smallest'...
You see all those signs on the road telling you about this stuff.
You'll never see such blatant advertising in Germany.&quot;
<P>
Jain also told us about the Grand Canyon and other places he'd
visited on his bike, which sounded like a great trip. &quot;2
weeks?&quot; he said to me, &quot;I could never get used to vacations
this short.&quot;
<P>
Larry, Jeremy and I then walked to the beach. It's very secluded
and very pretty, though Larry and Jeremy stayed enamored of it
longer than I did. I came back to camp and soon enough, another
cycle tourist showed up. His name was Cole, he was from Berkeley,
and was full of opinions and himself.
<P>
For instance, he rode 90 miles a day, never stopped, and didn't
carry a camera because it would slow him down. &quot;If you could
kick in those 20 miles before breakfast, then another 40 before
lunch, and then the rest before dinner, you can do it. Breakfast
is a very important meal, you know.&quot; Did he stop or take
any sidetrips? &quot;No. What for?&quot; He broke his frame in
Florence and spent a week laid up in Eugene while waiting for
a replacement. What a guy.
<P>
After Jeremy and Larry got back, Jeremy, Larry, Jain and I sat
around and played cards while Cole chain-smoked and set up camp.
Then we chatted till about 10pm and gradually everyone turned
in.
<H1>They're Americans... Who knows why they do this stuff? </H1>

<P>
June 23rd, 1994
<P>
Got up to the sound of Jain's MSR X-GK pumping away. Boy, that
thing sure sounds like a blowtorch. Jain was running out of gas,
so I gave him all of mine, reasoning that I'd be travelling with
Jeremy and Larry for the last day of my tour and wouldn't have
to use my gas anyway.
<P>
He boiled water and I took advantage of that to make some instant
oatmeal. Jain looked interested in it, so I gave him a couple
of packets to try. He liked it and thought it was a pretty neat
concept. He watched Jeremy and Larry unpack... &quot;Why are they
wearing underwear under their shorts?&quot; I shrugged. &quot;Do
they not get chafing and abrasion?&quot; &quot;Beats the hell
out of me, they're American... It certainly saves having to wash
your shorts!&quot;
<P>
Then everyone else was up and we were off. The climb up Humbug
Mountain was gentle and scenic, with the best scenery coming on
the descents. The clouds burned off before we were a couple of
miles down the road, and we stopped at a scenic spot to take some
photos, and I put on my sunscreen. I had one photo left, and was
determined to save it for the California Border.
<P>
The ride really picked up, however, after we got to Gold Beach
and started to climb Cape Sebastian. The climb was long (about
45 minutes) and I set the pace, pushing up the hill at about 7mph.
My knees felt it after that one. Fortunately, a long steep 40mph
descent followed after that, and I really enjoyed it. This was
my top speed throughout the entire coast tour.
<P>
And then it was down a long flat patch with a bit of headwind,
and another climb to Cape Arch, which was pretty. We had lunch
there, and the blue water sparkled in the bright sunlight. Cole
caught up with us, then and stopped too to look around.
<P>
We hadn't left Cape Arch for more than 20 minutes, however, when
he zoomed past us, shouting, &quot;See ya in town!&quot;
<P>
We rolled past several attractions and scenic sidetrips after
that, not because we were trying to catch Cole, but because we
were running out of water, and who could slow down to a zero after
having built up a momentum to about 35mph? That is the great fault
of bicycle touring, I feel.
<P>
The roll into Brookings was then done under a strong tailwind,
and we soared into Harris Beach State Park, set up camp, and then
unloaded our bikes and rode into town for groceries, bike shop,
and the Greyhound station. I found out where everything was. (The
bike shop is right across the street from Greyhound, and more
than happy to supply bike boxes to cyclists --- by the way, both
of these have moved, and are no longer accurately described by
Kirkendall and Spring. The street to look for is &quot;Railroad&quot;,
and it's a right turn from downtown Brookings on 101. Ask around.)
<P>
Then it was a shower and dinner. Larry and Jeremy wanted to see
a movie (Cops and Robbersons) and I declined, and joined up with
other cyclists who'd just rolled in (Andy from the East Coast,
Alan from Wales by way of San Francisco). Alan was a real character,
down to his tent (a $40 deal from K-mart that looks like it'll
blow away and fall over any time a strong wind blew), his attitude,
(&quot;Can I borrow your stove?&quot; he says, &quot;My camping
partner will be joining me tommorrow, and in the mean time, I
gotta eat something.&quot;) and his constant use of &quot;bloody&quot;
and &quot;bleedin'&quot;.
<P>
Andy and I walked down to the beach after helping Alan with his
tent, and there we talked and watched the sunset, which was so
beautiful that I had to take a photograph, and used up my last
photo with no regrets.
<P>
Back to camp, I read a bit and then slept. I called my family
to ensure that I had a pick up in San Francisco.
<H1>We mean business! </H1>

<P>
June 24th, 1994.
<P>
I got up in the morning depressed. My trip was over, effectively.
I still had to ride to the California border, but that was something
I could do anytime. I eventually had breakfast with Jeremy and
Larry, who left right after that, and sat around some more waiting
for the weather (which was foggy) to get better. When the fog
started rolling in, I packed everything up and got onto my bike
and rolled out.
<P>
South of Brookings, the place easily became more recognizably
countryside. I could still see to the Ocean a fair distance away,
but until the weather got better (which happened as I neared the
California border), I wouldn't really get to see to the horizon.
<P>
I watched the mileposts instead... 394, 395, 396, 397, and then...
<P>
&quot;Thank you for visiting Oregon, Come back soon!&quot;
<P>
(Yeah, you wouldn't believe how soon!)
<P>
and...
<P>
&quot;Welcome to California... We mean business.&quot;
<P>
I made a U-turn, hit the other side of the road, and ate a little
and draink a little. And then, lacking some rain to mark the occassion,
raised my water bottle and made some. Droplets of water filled
the air for a while and came down on me.
<P>
I looked once more at the state line, took my feet off the ground
and pushed...
<P>
The sun came out as I rolled back into Oregon.
<H2>July 1st, 1994. </H2>

<P>
Sunnyvale, California.
<P>
It doesn't take strength or endurance, just a lot of patience
<H2>Epilogue </H2>

<P>
I managed to take apart my bike with just a Ritchey CPR-14 and
the adjustable wrench, after which I loaded it into a bike box,
and took the Greyhound to San Francisco. It was a long ride, and
I slept badly. Hours after my family picked me up, I was in a
Dim Sum place gobbling huge amounts of food down and scaring everyone
in my family and all the waiters, etc.
<P>
My doctor has told me not to climb mountains or do any long rides
for a week or 10 days, so I can commute and do flat rides but
not much more. I'm icing my knee every night now.

<H3>Conclusions </H3>

<P>
It's nice to be in good shape to do a tour, but not necessary.
I'm a lot weaker this year than I was last year, but I enjoyed
this tour considerably more because of better weather and more
experience in bad weather.
<P>
Having one extra person along seems to help so much that I'll
go to great lengths to get just one extra person along. It reduces
weight, speeds up setting up camp and breaking camp, and on windy
days, you travel faster and with less fatigue. With an extra person,
you can prepare more elaborate meals and eat better.
<P>
My favorite days were less than 30 miles each, when I just roll
along and stop and made every sidetrip I could. The sidetrips
in Kirkendall and Spring are often well worth taking if you have
the strength and energy left.
<P>
Best time down the coast appears to be September, with relatively
dry weather, and not too many camper-type vehicles, but doing
it in June is also nice because you get treated like a celebrity.
Apparently the celebrity effects disappear as the summer progresses.
<P>
I love touring: my experience with it seems to get better and
better, and my only problem now is deciding which to do next:
California Coast, Europe, or Cross Country.
<P>
I'll never take Greyhound again if I can help it.
<P>
Credit card touring seems like a useful option, especially for
short tours. Don't know whether I'd do it for long tours. Also,
you miss the hiker biker sites. Hiker biker sites are the best,
because no bikers bring noisy kids, so it's very quiet. Everyone
sleeps at around 10pm, and few people smoke. Everyone leaves early,
and I never met a biker I hated. It got so much so I had trouble
sleeping in a real building when I got back.
<H2>Appendix E </H2>

<H3>Equipment Recommendations </H3>

<P>
The Bob Musette was very useful. I used it to carry flashlight,
lanterns, books, etc when I was walking around campsites. I also
used it to carry stuff back from town to the campsite. For the
$3 price, it was definitely worth the cash.
<P>
I didn't even get a single flat this time. I'm swearing by Conti
tires from now on.
<P>
The camping pillow was a luxury, but I find that I can't sleep
on a plastic bag, nor can I sleep on a stuff sack stuffed with
clothing. (Not to mention that most of my clothing gets hung out
on a clothesline overnight)
<P>
Next time, I'd like to experiment with different panniers, especially
if I'm going off-pavement a bit --- bungee cords just don't hold
things down as well.
<P>
The throwaway type cameras seem to work well.

<H3>Encaustic Painting (Courtesy of 2nd Street Gallery) </H3>

<P>
Encaustic is one of the oldest methods of painting. It was used
in ancient Greece and Egypt. The best preserved examples can be
seen in the Louvre and at the museum at Volos, Greece. Some of
the best examples date back to the fourteenth century B.C.
<P>
Encaustic is a form of painting with pigmented beeswax which is
melted and painted onto a firm surface and then burned with a
torch. The burn-in process makes the wax more resistant to heat
and abrasion. When properly applied and burned-in, encaustic is
among the most permanent techniques, for the painted film is impervious
to the kinds of deterioation commonly found in work done in water
based or oil based mediums.
<P>
Maintenance of encaustic paintings: To maintain luster of painting
a quick buff from time to time with a soft cotton cloth is all
that is needed. Do not hang in direct sunlight, but if encaustic
gets overheated simply cool, then rebuff to the original luster.
Do not use scouring pads or powder.

<P>
In case you're wondering. I took 5 lines of notes a day. So yes,
most of this was from memory.
