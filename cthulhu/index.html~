of Cthulhu d20</a> first came out, I enthusiastically embarked on a
quest to convert the classic adventure <a

of Nyarlathotep</a> to d20. I originally intended to publish the
conversion under the standard d20 license, but along the way, I sent
e-mail to Lynn Willis, the <a
href="http://www.chaosium.com/">Chaosium</a> editor overseeing the
Call of Cthulhu line. He informed me that Chaosium was the only entity
with rights to d20 conversions of any classic adventures, and agreed
to buy my d20 conversion if I did it professionally. I quickly agreed
and submitted the conversion on time.
<p>
Fast forward a few years, and Chaosium has publicly acknowledged that
they will not publish any more d20 material, and Lynn has graciously agreed to
allow me to publish my conversion on the internet for everyone to
enjoy!
